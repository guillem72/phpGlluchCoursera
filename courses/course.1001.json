Learn about such fundamental distributed computing \"concepts\" for cloud computing. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some of these concepts include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clouds, MapReduce, key-value stores<\/li>\n<li>Classical precursors<\/li>\n<li>Widely-used algorithms<\/li>\n<li>Classical algorithms <\/li>\n<li>Scalability<\/li>\n<li>Trending areas<\/li>\n<li>And more!<\/li><\/ul><p>Understand&nbsp;<strong>how these techniques work<\/strong>&nbsp;inside today\u2019s most widely-used cloud computing systems. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the&nbsp;<strong>optional programming track<\/strong>, implement some of these concepts in template assignments provided in C++ programming language.<\/p><p>You will also watch interviews with leading managers and researchers, from both industry and academia.<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p>This course will be broken up into 5 weekly modules covering the following topics:<br><\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 1: <\/strong>Orientation, Intro to Clouds, MapReduce <\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 2: <\/strong>Gossip, Membership, Grids <\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 3: <\/strong>P2P Systems<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 4: <\/strong>Key-Value Stores, Time and Ordering<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 5: <\/strong>Snapshots, Multicast, Paxos<\/p>\n<p><strong>And there's more!

No textbook is required.","estimatedClassWorkload":"4-8 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<p>This course assumes some basic knowledge of working computer systems. This course is generally oriented towards either graduate students (or senior undergraduates) or developers in industry who are working with cloud computing systems. Some familiarity with cloud computing systems helps, but is not a prerequisite. In the optional programming track, familiarity with C++ programming language is required.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course does not teach you how to use cloud computing systems or about networking or Big Data. If we were to draw an analogy, if this course were about cars, then it would teach you the physics relating to the internals of the car (e.g., friction, transmission, gears, etc.) and basics about the internals of the car (e.g., about the carburetor, engine, etc.). The course would not, however, teach you how to drive a car or about automobile accident statistics or about how roads are built.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take this course if you\u2019re curious about cloud computing systems. Do not take this course if you know nothing about computers or computer science.<\/p>","links":{}}
