What if\n    the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?\u00a0 This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning.\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><b>WEEK THREE - February 10, 2014<br>Teaching Like It\u2019s 1992 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>\n    <br>The World changed on April 22, 1993, when the scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released the Internet and the World Wide Web to the general public. \u00a0From then on, anyone with access to an Internet connection could\n    communicate\u00a0 to anyone else with an Internet connection. \u00a0No editor or publisher provides a safety net now and, at the same time, our data can be hacked, our privacy invaded.\u00a0 The digital world we live in now comes with tremendous responsibilities and opportunity--and yet it comes with real inequalities, perils, and obstacles too. \u00a0Does our educational system prepare us for these challenges?\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><b>WEEK FOUR - February 17, 2014<br>Welcome to the Future: 10 Ways to Change the Paradigm of Higher Education<\/b>\n    <br>We will now be looking at different principles, methods and metrics for redesigning an innovative form of learning that helps us all navigate the complexities of the world we inhabit outside of school. \u00a0This week we focus specifically on innovations\n    to the curriculum.\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><b>WEEK FIVE - February 24, 2014<br>Innovations in Pedagogy (Methods) and Assessment<\/b>\n    <br>This week we will focus on innovations in pedagogy (the methods for learning) and assessment. \u00a0How you teach is what you teach.\u00a0 And, we need to think deeply about what we value and make sure what we value is what we count.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>WEEK SIX - March 3, 2014<br>How to Make Institutional Change<\/b>\u00a0\n    <br>Even if we make changes in our personal learning and teaching methods, we still have to work mostly within institutions of learning.\u00a0 Institutional change can be difficult; it takes patience, strategy, and allies. This week offers (and also invites)\n    ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.\u00a0 This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b>\n<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Thank you for joining this movement on behalf of educational innovation and reform! \u00a0This is not the end. \u00a0It\u2019s the beginning. \u00a0Where will we do from here?
