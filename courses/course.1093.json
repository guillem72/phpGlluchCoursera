    "shortDescription": "Abortion is a common experience for women around the world; yet, abortion is often excluded from the curricula of health professionals.  This course, geared toward clinicians, health care workers, and students, aims to address this gap and will contextualize abortion care within a public health framework from both clinical and social perspectives.  ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Abortion is\na common experience for reproductive-aged women around the world.&nbsp; In the US, half of all pregnancies are\nunintended and half of these end in abortion. (Finer 2013) Around the world,\n43.8 million abortions were done in 2008 representing one fifth of all\npregnancies. (Sedgh 2012)&nbsp; Abortion is\nsafe and has lower morbidity and mortality than childbirth when carried out by\ntrained practitioners in sanitary conditions (Raymond 2012), but nearly half of\nthe abortions done in the world are unsafe, according to the WHO definition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite\nits universality, abortion remains controversial and inaccessible for many\nwomen. Both the clinical and public health contexts of abortion are often\nexcluded from curricula in medicine, nursing, and other health professions. Restrictions\nat the hospital or clinic level, and conscientious objection at the provider\nlevel compounded with legal restrictions further reduce women’s access to\nservices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In this six-week\ncourse, over twenty faculty from various institutions and multiple disciplines will place abortion within the context of\npublic health and fill in the gaps left by its exclusion from mainstream\ncurricula in health professions. Each week’s lectures will incorporate the\nstories of women who seek abortion in order to better portray abortion significance and rationale.&nbsp; Other topics will include a brief\nhistory of abortion, the clinical aspects of medication and procedural\nabortions in and after the first trimester, an overview of patient-centered\nabortion-care, the basics of abortion counseling, the professional obligations\nof health care practitioners to ensure that women have access to safe abortion\ncare, and the maze of restrictions that make safe abortion care inaccessible to\nmany women.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to video lectures, there will be\nweekly quizzes, peer assessments, and optional additional content and reading\nfor learners who want to explore the topic further.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>",
