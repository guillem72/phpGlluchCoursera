{"id":1119,"shortName":"logic2","name":"Logic: Language and Information 2","language":"en","shortDescription":"This is an introduction to predicate logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics, mathematics and philosophy. Building on your knowledge of propositional logic, you will learn predicate logic\u2014its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines.","aboutTheCourse":"Information is everywhere: in our words and our world, our thoughts and our theories, our devices and our databases.\u00a0<i>Logic<\/i>\u00a0is the study of that information: the features it has, how it\u2019s represented, and how we can manipulate it.\u00a0<i>Learning<\/i>\u00a0logic helps you formulate and answer many different questions about information:<br><ul><li>Does this hypothesis clash with the evidence we have or is it consistent with the evidence?<\/li><li>Is this argument watertight, or do we need to add more to make the conclusion to really follow from the premises?<\/li><li>Do these two sentences say the same things in different ways, or do they say something subtly different?<\/li><li>Does this information follow from what\u2019s in this database, and what procedure could we use to get the answer quickly?<\/li><li>Is there a more cost-effective design for this digital circuit? And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?<\/li><\/ul>These are questions about <i>Logic<\/i>. When you learn logic you'll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we're dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven't yet imagined.\u00a0Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.<br><br>This subject follows from <i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/logic1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/logic1\">Logic<\/a><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/logic1\" target=\"_blank\">: <\/a><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/logic1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/logic1\">Language and Information 1<\/a><\/i>, to cover core techniques in first order predicate logic: the idea of formal languages with quantifiers, which gives us a way to talk about more logical structure than in propositional logic; and we will cover the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs in predicate logic.

They will contain integrated quiz questions to give you immediate feedback. There will be practice problems available for your to sharpen your skills, and grading problems to form a part of your final grade. In weeks 5-8 there are five topics, from which each student is expected to choose at least two. These will be assessed by a combination of quizzes and short assignments. There is a final exam to wrap everything up.","suggestedReadings":"The course is self contained, with all required resources available online.<br><br>The textbook\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.routledge.com\/books\/details\/9780415400688\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Logic<\/i><\/a>\u00a0(Greg Restall, Routledge 2000; especially chapters 8 to 15) covers most but not all of the material in this course.

Beyond that, you need to be able to read and write, and be prepared to think, work and learn new skills\u2014in particular, a willingness to work with symbolic representation and reasoning.","links":{}}
