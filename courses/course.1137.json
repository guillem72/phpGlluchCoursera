Students are challenged to think of the Earth as an integrated system made up of water, air, ice, land, and life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p><p>For example, students learn that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago produced massive extinctions of life on Earth that forever altered the dominant types of single-celled life. &nbsp;Students are exposed to how new scientific discoveries are made through the observations that led to plate tectonics, how the Moon formed, and why dinosaurs went extinct.<\/p><div><br><\/div>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<b>1.&nbsp; Building blocks of the Earth's climate<\/b><br><ul><li>How science works<\/li><li>How Earth's climate works<\/li><li>What is geologic time?<\/li><li>Rocks and minerals<\/li><li>How old is the Earth?<br><\/li><\/ul><b>2.
