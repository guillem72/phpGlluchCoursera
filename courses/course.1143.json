    "aboutTheCourse": "Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to design, implementation and evaluation that holds the key to the successful development of complex human-made systems. This course explores a framework encapsulating the entire systems engineering discipline, clearly showing where the multitude of associated activities fits within the overall effort and how the activities relate to one another.&nbsp; Systems engineering is a very broad discipline, so we also discuss how the concepts and procedures could be applied to individual projects. A new theme will be explored each week using presentations to introduce and synthesise key concepts, examples to simulate authentic contexts, and structured activities to guide your learning. <br><br>The course is relevant to all professions associated with the introduction of complex human-made systems: project managers, engineers, quality assurance representatives, integrated logistic support practitioners, operators, managers, maintainers, and so on, from students to professionals, from novices to experienced practitioners, from technical to non-technical people. <br><br>",
