{"id":1188,"shortName":"astrotech","name":"AstroTech: The Science and Technology behind Astronomical Discovery","language":"en","shortDescription":"How astronomy really works - an overview of the technology that astronomers use to collect and measure light from the universe, and how it is used in practice to make scientific discoveries.\n","aboutTheCourse":"\"How do they know that?\"\n<br><br>Modern astronomy has made some astonishing discoveries - how stars burn and how black holes form; galaxies from the edge of the universe and killer rocks right next door; where the elements come from and how the expanding universe is accelerating. But\n    how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge\n    of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.\n    <br><br>Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result.\u00a0\u00a0 We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with\n    some basic physics, how we the interpret the data to make scientific discoveries. <br><br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p><span>Week-1 - <b>Science and Technology :\na marriage made in Heaven<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul><li><span>\u00a0 Our Knowledge of the Universe<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Revolutions in Astronomy<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0\u00a0Why Astronomy is hard<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0\u00a0The Horse and the Cart<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><span>Week-2 - <b>Telescopes : Picturing\nthe Universe<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul><li><span>\u00a0 Example story : we are stardust <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The technology : how telescopes\nwork <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Putting it together : we are\nstardust part II\u00a0 <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Big Telescopes of the future <\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><span>Week-3 - <b>Space : Getting above it\nall<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul><li><span>\u00a0 Example story : hunting for\nblack holes <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The technology : rockets,\nspacecraft, and orbits <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Putting it together : hunting\nfor black holes part II<\/span><\/li><li><span><span>\u00a0 <\/span>The future : can space missions get\ncheaper? <\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n<p>Week-4 - <b>Detectors : Catching the light from the stars <\/b><\/p>\n\n<ul><li><span>\u00a0 Example story : galaxies from\nthe dawn of time <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The technology : CCDs and\ninfra-red arrays<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Putting it together : galaxies\nfrom the dawn of time part II<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Is there another revolution in\ndetector technology?<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Week-5 -<b> Computers : Crunching the data<\/b><\/p><ul><li><span>\u00a0 Example story : killer rocks <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The technology : computers, databases\nand the internet<\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Putting it together : killer\nrocks part II <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The future : hitting the\nbuffers?<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Week-6 - <b>Spectrographs : Taking the fingerprints of the stars<\/b><\/p>\n\n<ul><li><span>\u00a0 Example story : the accelerating\nuniverse and dark energy <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The technology : how\nspectrographs work <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 Putting it together : dark\nenergy part II <\/span><\/li><li><span>\u00a0 The perfect spectrograph? <\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>","courseFormat":"The class will consist of video lectures, weekly quizzes, and discussion forums.
