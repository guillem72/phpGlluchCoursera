Materials from the MOOC offerings have been available for self-study on Coursera as well as on other platforms. <strong>Starting in summer 2014, the materials are now being offered on the OpenEdX platform as a set of smaller self-paced \"mini-courses\", which can be assembled in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases.<\/strong> All of the mini-courses are based around video lectures and\/or video demos. Many of them include in-video quizzes to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and\/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive programming exercises. Each mini-course also includes a discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Databases course. <strong>To explore and enroll in the new Databases mini-courses, please visit<\/strong> <a title=\"Link: https:\/\/class.stanford.edu\/courses\/DB\/2014\/SelfPaced\/about\" href=\"https:\/\/class.stanford.edu\/courses\/DB\/2014\/SelfPaced\/about\">https:\/\/class.stanford.edu\/courses\/DB\/2014\/SelfPaced\/about<\/a>.","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<b> <\/b>","courseFormat":"","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Jennifer Widom, Professor","estimatedClassWorkload":"","recommendedBackground":"<b> <\/b>","links":{}}
