However, despite the rhetoric, in many sites and many ways <strong>education is still relatively untouched by technology<\/strong>. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the <strong>results seem disappointing<\/strong>. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. <strong>Technology might not even represent a step forward in education<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course explores <strong>7 affordances of e-learning ecologies<\/strong>, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning\u2014transformative, 21st century learning:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ubiquitous Learning<\/li>\n<li>Active Knowledge Making<\/li>\n<li>Multimodal Meaning<\/li>\n<li>Recursive Feedback<\/li>\n<li>Collaborative Intelligence<\/li>\n<li>Metacognition<\/li>\n<li>Differentiated Learning<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will <strong>prepare learners<\/strong> for success in a world that is <strong>increasingly dominated by digital information flows<\/strong> and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life.
