    "aboutTheCourse": "<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/elearning\/images\/elearning1.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 5px; width:270px;\" alt=\"\">\n<p>For more than 3 decades we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the <strong>transformative power of technology<\/strong> in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many sites and many ways <strong>education is still relatively untouched by technology<\/strong>. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the <strong>results seem disappointing<\/strong>. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. <strong>Technology might not even represent a step forward in education<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course explores <strong>7 affordances of e-learning ecologies<\/strong>, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learningâ€”transformative, 21st century learning:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ubiquitous Learning<\/li>\n<li>Active Knowledge Making<\/li>\n<li>Multimodal Meaning<\/li>\n<li>Recursive Feedback<\/li>\n<li>Collaborative Intelligence<\/li>\n<li>Metacognition<\/li>\n<li>Differentiated Learning<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will <strong>prepare learners<\/strong> for success in a world that is <strong>increasingly dominated by digital information flows<\/strong> and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of <strong>learning technologies<\/strong> and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, <strong>demonstrate these affordances in action<\/strong>.<\/p><br>",
