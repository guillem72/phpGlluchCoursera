{"id":121,"shortName":"dsp","name":"Digital Signal Processing","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.","aboutTheCourse":"The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the \u201cdigital revolution\u201d that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. <br><br> In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"Broad outline of the topics covered in the class:\u00a0<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Introduction: What is signal processing, history of the topic, application examples.<\/li><li>Discrete-time (DT) signals: the discrete-time complex exponential, and a computer music synthesis example.<\/li><li>Euclid and Hilbert: Signal processing as geometry, vectors spaces, bases, approximations.<\/li><li>Fourier Analysis: The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and series (DFS).

Students are encouraged to implement many of the course topics in the programming language of their choice; worked out examples in Python will be provided on a weekly basis. The final grade will be based on the students' performance in weekly homework sets, which will include applied coding problems.<\/p>","suggestedReadings":"A companion textbook is available both in printed format and electronically on the web (free of charge).
