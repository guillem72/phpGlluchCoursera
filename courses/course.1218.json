Three\nmain topics are covered: \u00a0social choice\ntheory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<span>In the first week we consider the problem of\naggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the\nchallenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most\nimportant theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which\nproves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite\nand Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.\u00a0 We\nmove on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are\nself interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain\n\"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions\nbetween self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our\nthird week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate\nhappiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.\u00a0 The\ncourse wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating\nscarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an\nintroduction to auction theory.\u00a0<\/span>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<div>\n\n<p><span>There will be four weeks of materials consisting of online\nvideos and problem sets.
