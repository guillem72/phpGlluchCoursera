We are providing a <a href=\"http:\/\/bagwell.kennesaw.edu\/files\/2214\/1642\/1515\/Meetup_Protocol_General.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Facilitator's Guide<\/a> to support teacher professional learning groups. Meeting once per week in a face-to-face environment to discuss, share resources, and peer critique is advised; however, each person should complete independent assignments\u2026no\n    group projects. Your projects may be closely related, though. For example, in this course you will design a blended or online unit for your class. If a grade level team at the same school decides to divide up the curriculum such that each teacher\n    designs a separate social studies unit for his\/her grade level team, then the grade level team\u2019s projects would closely relate while not becoming a single group project. Think professional development jigsaw activity!<\/p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a colleague to work with, you can take this class alone. Really you will never be alone! You could harness Google Hangouts or Skype to work with someone you meet in the discussion forums.
