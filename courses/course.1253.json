What do these vital signs tell you about your body? Learn the basic physiology underlying the vital signs and how to accurately assess them.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>The vital signs \u2013 heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature,\nrespiration rate, and pain \u2013 communicate important information about the\nphysiological status of the human body. In this six-week course we explore the anatomy\nand physiology underlying the vital signs so that you will develop a\nsystematic, integrated understanding of how the body functions. Relevant body\nsystems are reviewed including cardiovascular<b>&nbsp;<\/b>and respiratory, followed by explanations of how\nthe function of these systems affects vital signs. We discuss normal ranges,\nnormal variants, and the mechanisms that underlie changes in the objective\nmeasurement of vital signs. The course also includes demonstrations of\nappropriate techniques for measuring vital signs in yourself and others.<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p><b>Week\nOne: Overview and Heart Anatomy<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview and introduction to\ncourse<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anatomy of the heart<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulmonary and systemic\ncirculation<\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart valves and the one-way\nflow of blood through the heart<\/p>\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cardiac conduction\nsystem and electrocardiograms (ECGs)<\/p>\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardiac output, heart rate,\nand pulse<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Week\nTwo: Blood Pressure<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anatomy of blood vessels<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systolic versus diastolic\npressure \u2013what are they are and what they mean<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mean arterial pressure \u2013what\nis it and how is it regulated?<\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What keeps blood circulating\nthrough the body<\/p>\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measuring blood pressure<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Week\nThree: Metabolism<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anabolism versus catabolism<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of energy pathways\nin the cells<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How metabolism relates to\nthe vital signs<\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metabolic assessment\ndemonstration<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Week\nFour: Temperature<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temperature regulation<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mean temperature<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessing body temperature <\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperthermia, hypothermia\nand fever<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Week\nFive: Respiratory Rate<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulmonary anatomy and review\nof pulmonary circulation<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capillary gas exchange<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metabolism and respiratory\nregulation<\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessing respiration and\nlung sounds<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Week\nSix: Pain and Conclusion<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic neurologic and sensory\nanatomy<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain tolerance and pain\nthreshold<\/p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessing pain<\/p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding what pain is\ntelling us<\/p>\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Course wrap up<\/p>","courseFormat":"The\ncourse consists of videos that: 1) describe the structure and function of\nrelevant organ systems; 2) describe the physiological processes that produce\nthe vital signs; and 3) demonstrate the correct techniques to assess\nvital signs. Some of the videos are lecture style while others are\nconversational. Each week consists of 8-10 videos, with each video typically lasting 8-12\nminutes. Several quiz questions are incorporated into the weekly videos, allowing\nstudents to self-assess their learning of key concepts. There are also weekly\nstand-alone quizzes in which course content is contextualized into case study\nscenarios, allowing students to apply their knowledge to real life situations.<br><span><br>Students who complete course requirements will earn a Statement of Accomplishment.
