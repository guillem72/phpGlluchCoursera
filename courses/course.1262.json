The goal of\nthis class is to prepare students for success in General Chemistry by honing\ntheir chemistry problem solving skills. <br><br>In this class, we will review fundamental mathematical\nskills, as well as provide strategies for general chemistry problem solving. &nbsp;Focus will be placed on selected conceptual areas of chemistry, and then delve deeply into application of these concepts to solve real-world problems. &nbsp;The class emphasizes critical thinking, solution strategies for complex chemical problems and foundational math skills. &nbsp;A goal of this course is to train students to think like scientists, and prepare them for success in university courses in science, technology engineering and mathematics.<br><br>I hope that you enjoy the class!","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<b>Week 1 - Introduction and Warm Up: <\/b>Preliminary Assessment given to appraise current knowledge and help set goals; introductory material, including matter and energy, classification and properties of matter, scientific measurement and units, significant figures, dimensional analysis, and problem-solving strategies.<b><br><br>Week 2 - Boot-Camp I: &nbsp;<\/b>Understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, which includes properties of waves, wave-particle duality, the interaction of radiation and matter, the photoelectric effect and the Bohr atom model.<br><br><b>Week 3 - Boot-Camp II:<\/b> Introducing the concept of mole and understanding how compounds form, by differentiating ionic and covalent bonding, learning how to write molecular and empirical formulas and how to determine percent composition of compounds.

Students will be asked a series of chemistry questions, followed by\ntheir level of confidence in each of their answers. The purpose of this\nassessment is to make students aware of their current knowledge, as well\nhelp set learning goals for the class. As such, it is important that students take the\npreliminary exam seriously, and are honest about what they understand.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Learning Modules<\/b><\/p><p>There will be four learning modules per week for the first\nfive weeks. Ideally, students will complete one module per day, leaving Friday\nfor the End-of-Week Review. Modules will be released Mondays at 10:01am EST, and are due on\n10:00am EST the following Monday. Each learning module consists of the following:<\/p><ul><li>A lecture\nvideo in which the concepts will be outlined and narrated by the instructor<br><\/li><li>A series of conceptually-based questions embedded within the\nlecture video itself<\/li><li>A video in which a set of relevant worked\nproblems of progressively higher difficulty, narrated by the instructor, are solved<br><\/li><li>A short problem-solving quiz related to the concepts and worked problems<br><\/li><li>A link to more problems that\nstudents may use for practice<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p><b>End-of-Week Review<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>After each weekly learning module, students will be given additional\nreview material and practice. The review will consist of the following:<\/p><p><\/p><ul><li>An exciting laboratory\ndemonstration to aid in connecting the material learned to the physical world.<\/li><li>A video demonstrating the solution of several highly challenging cross-cutting problems that bring together concepts and skills from several learning modules.<br><\/li><li>A set of 10 challenge problems, to be turned in, that generally will encompass more than one learning objective.<br><\/li><li>A set of Chemistry Sleuth problems,\nin which students will become detectives and \"buy\" clues in order to determine the most cost effective solution to the problem. &nbsp; Students\nare encouraged to discuss different ways to solve the problems on the discussion forums, and complete solutions (not just answers)\nmay be submitted for peer-grading for 1 extra credit point each.<\/li><li>A comprehensive weekly assessment\nQuiz consisting of 10 questions.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Exam Review Week<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>Week 6 will serve as an exam preparation week.
