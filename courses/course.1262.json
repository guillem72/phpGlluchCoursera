    "shortDescription": "The course develops critical thinking and analytic problem solving skills within a chemistry context in order to prepare students for success in college-level General Chemistryâ€”a key gateway class required for many undergraduate majors.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Chemistry is about atoms and molecules and their transformations,\nand is referred to as the <i>Central Science<\/i> because it connects the\nphysical and life sciences. &nbsp;General Chemistry is your gateway into chemistry, and is\nrequired for majors in just about every field of science, technology and\nmedicine. &nbsp;General Chemistry trains students to think like scientists\nthrough the application of chemical principles to solve problems.<br><br>College-level general chemistry, however, is extremely\nfast-paced, and students are faced with challenges of absorbing new chemistry\nconcepts at the same time they are applied to complex problems. The goal of\nthis class is to prepare students for success in General Chemistry by honing\ntheir chemistry problem solving skills. <br><br>In this class, we will review fundamental mathematical\nskills, as well as provide strategies for general chemistry problem solving. &nbsp;Focus will be placed on selected conceptual areas of chemistry, and then delve deeply into application of these concepts to solve real-world problems. &nbsp;The class emphasizes critical thinking, solution strategies for complex chemical problems and foundational math skills. &nbsp;A goal of this course is to train students to think like scientists, and prepare them for success in university courses in science, technology engineering and mathematics.<br><br>I hope that you enjoy the class!",
