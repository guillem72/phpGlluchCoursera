{"id":127,"shortName":"crypto2","name":"Cryptography II","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and protocols and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications.","aboutTheCourse":"Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. &nbsp;This course is a continuation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/crypto\">Crypto I<\/a> and explains the inner workings of public-key systems and cryptographic protocols. &nbsp; Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with constructions for digital signatures and their applications. &nbsp; We will then discuss protocols for user authentication and zero-knowledge protocols. &nbsp; &nbsp;Next we will turn to privacy applications of cryptography supporting anonymous credentials and private database lookup. &nbsp;We will conclude with more advanced topics including multi-party computation and elliptic curve cryptography. &nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field. &nbsp; The course will include written homeworks and optional programming labs. &nbsp;The material is self-contained, but the course assumes knowledge of the topics covered in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/crypto\">Crypto I<\/a> as well as a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"","courseFormat":"The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 20 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final exam.","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Dan Boneh, Professor","estimatedClassWorkload":"6-8 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/crypto\">Crypto I<\/a>","links":{}}
