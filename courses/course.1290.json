We will explore how films have defined marriage, identified seven core problems, and varied its three narrative components -- a couple, their problems, their situation -- from decade to decade from the silent to the modern era.","aboutTheCourse":"From the beginning of motion picture history, marriage has been a topic for popular story-telling, but Hollywood struggled with a subject that presented problems an audience already knew and perhaps did not want to see as entertainment.\n<br>\n<br>How the film-making business crafted tales that were simultaneously an \"I do!\" of happiness and an \"I don't!\" of disappointment is a fascinating reflection of America's history, changing social attitudes, shifting morals and gender roles. Hollywood found\nways both to reflect reality and deflect misery as decade after decade, movies adjusted a basic formula to audience needs.\n<br>\n<br>Film clips and still photographs will illustrate how films defined marriage in the movies, identified a core seven problems, and varied its three narrative components -- a couple, their problems, their situation -- from decade to decade from the silent\nto the modern era.\n<br>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"5 weeks, 10 films, 22 lectures<br><br><b>WEEK I<\/b>\n<br>Introduction<br>Lecture 1: An Overview on Marriage and the Movies<br>Lecture 2: Hollywood and Marriage<br>Lecture 3: The Silent Era<br>Lecture 4: The Silent Era part II<br>Film 1: WILD ORCHIDS (Franklin, 1929) (<a href=\"http:\/\/shop.warnerarchive.com\/product\/wild+orchids+1000179518.do?sortby=bestSellers&amp;refType=&amp;from=Search\" target=\"_blank\">Warner Archive<\/a> \/ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Orchids-Asther-Lewis-Stone-Greta\/dp\/B002EAYEGK\/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745668&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=wild+orchids\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br><br>Lecture 5: Defining the Marriage Movie<br>Film 2: MADE FOR EACH OTHER (Cromwell, 1939) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Made-Each-Other-Carole-Lombard\/dp\/B0002KPHY2\/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745760&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=made+for+each+other\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br><br><b>WEEK 2<\/b>\n<br>Lecture 6: The \"I Do\" and \"I Don't\" versions<br>Film 3: THE MARRYING KIND (Cukor, 1952) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Marrying-Kind-Judy-Holliday\/dp\/B0000C23T3\/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745788&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+marrying+kind\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>Lecture 7: Variations and Vignettes<br>\n<br>Lecture 8: The Couple<br>Lecture 9: The Couple part II<br>Film 4: ADAM'S RIB (Cukor, 1949) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Adams-Rib-Spencer-Tracy\/dp\/B00004TJOD\/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745811&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=adam%27s+rib\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>\n<br><b>WEEK 3<\/b>\n<br>Lecture 10: The Seven Recurring Problems<br>Lecture 11: Money and Infidelity<br>Film 5: BRIEF ENCOUNTER (Lean, 1945) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brief-Encounter-Criterion-Collection-Johnson\/dp\/0780023420\/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745881&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=brief+encounter+1945\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>Lecture 12: The Infidelity Story Over Time<br><br>Lecture 13: In-laws\/Kids and Class\/Incompatibility<br>Lecture 14: Incompatibility continued<br>Film 6: VIVACIOUS LADY (Stevens, 1938) (<a href=\"http:\/\/shop.warnerarchive.com\/product\/vivacious+lady+1000413210.do?sortby=bestSellers&amp;refType=&amp;from=Search\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/shop.warnerarchive.com\/product\/vivacious+lady+1000413210.do?sortby=bestSellers&amp;refType=&amp;from=Search\">Warner Archive<\/a> \/ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vivacious-James-Stewart-Ginger-Rogers\/dp\/B00FEFOK4I\/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745908&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=vivacious+lady\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>\n<br><b>WEEK 4<\/b>\n<br>Lecture 15:&nbsp;Addiction\/Murder<br>Film 7: SUSPICION (Hitchcock, 1941) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Suspicion-Cary-Grant\/dp\/B0002HOEOY\/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745962&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=suspicion+hitchcock\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br><br>Lecture 16: The Situation<br>Lecture 17: WWII Marriage Movies<br>Film 8: SINCE YOU WENT AWAY (Cromwell, 1944) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Since-You-Went-Away-Regions\/dp\/B004282QA8\/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392745998&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=since+you+went+away\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br><br>\n<br><b>WEEK 5<\/b>\n<br>Lecture 18: Post-WWII, TV<br>Lecture 19: Post-war continued<br>Lecture 20:&nbsp;\"The Modern Era\"&nbsp;<br>Film 9: HEARTBURN (Nichols, 1986) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Film-Favorites-Bridges-Defending-HEARTBURN\/dp\/B00AMSQBSU\/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392746061&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=heartburn\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>\n<br>Lecture 21: State of the Marriage Movie - \"Nuclear\" Marriages, Social Change<br>Film 10: THE WAR OF THE ROSES (DeVito, 1989) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/War-Roses-Michael-Douglas\/dp\/B0009X75PQ\/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392746103&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=war+of+the+roses\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>)<br>Lecture 22: Conclusions\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Assignments:\n<br>Multiple-choice quizzes during\/after each lecture (ungraded)<br>Longer cumulative multiple-choice quiz at the end\n(graded)<br>Online discussion opportunities\n<br>","courseFormat":"This class consists of 4-5 video lectures per week; each lecture runs 15 - 30 minutes in length (approximately 1 hour total per week).
