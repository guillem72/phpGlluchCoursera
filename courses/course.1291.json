{"id":1291,"shortName":"configuringworld","name":"Configuring the World: A Critical Political Economy Approach","language":"en","shortDescription":"In today\u2019s world, politics and economics are inextricably interconnected, but what is the nature of this connectivity? What are the power relationships that shape the world economy today and create new challenges for international institutions facing globalization? What makes some countries wealthier than others? Do we face cultural diversity or fragmentation? Does the type of governance effect economic development and social change or is it the other way around? How do we measure it and how trustworthy is the data?  These issues and many more will be examined in this course along with up-to-date sources and biting criticism.   ","aboutTheCourse":"<p>The course is composed\nof eight modules that together will introduce students to the influences that\nshape the world in which we live today and to some of the political economy\nconcepts used to explain them. It will examine the forces that explain the\ndifferences between success and failure in economic development and effective\ngovernment in different countries. It will view how these forces also interact\nin the global economy.&nbsp; <\/p><p>\n\n<\/p><p>The course will adopt a\n\u2018critical political economy approach\u2019 in two ways.&nbsp; It will criticize the data that are employed\nby social scientists to test their hypotheses on questions of governance and economic\ndevelopment.&nbsp; However, it will also raise\nthe prospect that the problems in economic development might lie at a more\nfundamental, systemic level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<img width=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/configuringworld\/course%20outline%202b%20medium.png\" height=\"532\" alt=\"Configuring the world overview\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Video clip from CtW 1<\/strong> - Prof. Richard Griffiths talks about the multinational corporations, how big they really are, and who controls most of them...\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k3MZODdHaFs&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"> <img width=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/configuringworld\/images\/CTW%20MNC.png\" height=\"225\"><\/a><br><strong><br><\/strong>\n\n<\/p><p><strong>Video clip from the 'Configuring the World' MOOC Google hangout<\/strong>\u2013Prof. Richard Griffiths and students discuss the change in the rank of Nepal in the Human Development Index, how it happened and the meaning of it to social scientists and statisticians and politicians.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UdHrqyURhPs&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/configuringworld\/images\/ctw%20google%20hangout.png\" height=\"225\"><\/a><br><\/p><p><strong><br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Extracts from the CtW1 DiscussionForum:<\/strong><br><\/p><p>\u201cI was surprisingly fascinated with this course\u2026 and do not get positively surprised very often. The degree of commitment,\nthe interest with which Professor Griffiths teaches, is admirable. He cares\nabout the threads, the questions that arise in discussions and tries to make a\nmassive open course participative and interesting or every one with success.\nFinally, I would like to say that this is one of the best and most motivating\ncourses I have ever taken, including my whole university career.\u201d(Elizabeth\nNagy, Lawyer, Uruguay)&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cI have to admit that I suspicious at\nfirst. But the ripping apart of the data indices is so interesting and useful\nthat I can do nothing more than recommend this course. It is a great antidote\nto those that want to use statistics without any examination whatsoever of how\nthe data was collected, what was collected, and how the indices were derived.\nWhat a breath of fresh air in the area of political economy, policy, and\npolitics\u2026\u201d (Karl Shepard, Professor of US and European history, USA)<\/p><p>\u201cFrom the first minute of the first\nvideo, I was hooked. After then it got better. I appreciate and enjoy the style\nand content of the course\u2026 I feel that the instructor has a gift for eloquent\ndiscourse presented in a direct way that makes sophisticated content\nintellectually available to anyone who cares to listens.(James P.

The courses do not have to be taken in any particular order.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;C<\/strong><strong>onfiguring the World.<\/strong> What do we know of the world? Mostly we know\nwhere most people live and whether they are richer or poorer. This module\nreexamines the patterns of world demographics and economic development. <\/p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;T<\/strong><strong>rust.<\/strong> Underlying all human activity is the concept of trust. At the\nextreme, the complete absence of trust, individuals fall back on closed circles\nof friendship and kinship and they will \u2018privatise\u2019 their involvement in public\ninstitutions. It the ensuing uncertainty, businesses will cut back their\nplanning perspectives and societies will start to fragment. <\/p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;In<\/strong><strong>equality and Fragmentation.<\/strong> Cultural differences can enrich societies,\nbut under different circumstances, they also serve to undermine social\ncohesion, and weaken the foundations of trust.&nbsp;\nExtremes in income distribution, whether geographically or individually,\nmay also have negative effects for society as a whole. <\/p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;G<\/strong><strong>overnance.<\/strong> Governance\nis the channel through which trust is linked to policy outcomes, such as growth\nand prosperity (and egalitarian policies). Poor institutional quality\nundermines trust, which in turn impacts on growth and prosperity. It also\naffects the ability of states to fulfil their international obligations. <\/p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;Ec<\/strong><strong>onomic Development and Social Change.<\/strong> Helping to promote economic\ndevelopment in other countries has been an international concern since the end\nof the second World War. Having seen decades of&nbsp; failure of development aid to close the\nincome gaps, the current orthodoxy is prioritizing the implementation of market\noriented institutional reform.<\/p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;Gl<\/strong><strong>obalisation.<\/strong> Over the past half century or more, the World has become\nmore interdependent. In the \u2018hyperglobalist\u2019 literature this is attributed to a\nreduced role of the state and the victory of market forces. But economic\nmarkets are political constructions, without which transactions will not\nhappen.<\/p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;(In<\/strong><strong>ternational) Institutions.<\/strong> The globalized economy is controlled and\nregulated by a network of international organizations. There is some debate\nabout the extent to which they serve to modify state behavior, and it is also\nimportant to reflect that&nbsp; they are also\nreflect the international power balance. <\/p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;T<\/strong><strong>he Locus of Control. <\/strong>Despite the focus of so much literature and\nanalysis on the level of nation states, it is businesses that trade, not\nstates. And it is international finance, rather than international trade that\nis responsible for most of the qualitative transformation of the world economy.\n<\/p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>The course will offer\ntwo tracks.
