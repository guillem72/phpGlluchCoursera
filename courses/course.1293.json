    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>How are international power relations changing and how can global peace and stability be maintained? This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected\n    international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security.&nbsp;<\/p><p>You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict,\n    what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. In the course, we also focus on the role of the European Union (EU) in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty\n    Organization (NATO) and the contribution of some other regional organizations to the prevention of conflict and war.&nbsp;<\/p><p>We also look at activities of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and, in the context of a final debate, see in\n    which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order.&nbsp;<\/p><p>You learn about all of these topics by doing quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, helping you understand\n    crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization can contribute to the search for global stability and peace in practice.<\/p>",
