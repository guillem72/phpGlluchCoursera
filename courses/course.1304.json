{"id":1304,"shortName":"regmods","name":"Regression Models","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn how to use regression models, the most important statistical analysis tool in the data scientist's toolkit. This is the seventh course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.","aboutTheCourse":"Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. \u00a0Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist\u2019s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"In this course students will learn how to fit regression models, how to interpret coefficients, how to investigate residuals and variability. \u00a0Students will further learn special cases of regression models including use of dummy variables and multivariable adjustment. Extensions to generalized linear models, especially considering Poisson and logistic regression will be reviewed.","courseFormat":"Weekly lecture videos and quizzes and a final peer-assessed project.","suggestedReadings":"","estimatedClassWorkload":"4-9 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"R programming, mathematical aptitude. The content in the \u00a0R Programming and Statistical Inference courses covers the necessary background. The material from Statistical inference could be taken concurrently with this class.","links":{}}
