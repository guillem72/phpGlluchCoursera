Along the way, we will introduce <strong>fundamental computer science principles and programming ideas<\/strong> that power today’s smartphone and tablet apps.<\/p>\n<p>We will also peek beyond the borders of Android programming to the world of computer science. Meet computer science undergraduates, see one of the first <strong>vacuum tube computers<\/strong>, the first <strong>transistor<\/strong>, and now-modern <strong>scientific research<\/strong> on the Blue Waters supercomputer—all at Illinois.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Android Developer Track: Weeks 1–5<\/strong> (required for passing the course):<br>\nThis portion of the course is intended to give you a <strong>slow and gentle introduction to the basics<\/strong> of Android application development such as downloading, installing, and setting up the tools you will use in this course. You will also <strong>create your first Android app<\/strong> and share the results of your experience with your classmates—all while writing hardly any code at all! <\/p><p>\n<\/p><p><strong>Computer Science and Programming Track: Weeks 6–8<\/strong> (optional):<br>\nDuring this latter portion of the course, you can <strong>delve deeper into computer science fundamentals<\/strong> and beginner programming techniques. Together we will explore this content while <strong>developing another really cool project<\/strong> to share.<\/p>",
