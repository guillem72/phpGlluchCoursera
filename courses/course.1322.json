This is the first part of a class which has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. The other two portions are Introduction to Computational Arts: Image Manipulation and Introduction to Computational Arts: Sound Art.<\/p><p>For programming we\u2019ll be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.<\/p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and an artistic project, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We\u2019ll cover the history of generative \u00a0art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.<\/p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data.<\/p><p>Additionally, you\u2019ll create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. \u00a0<\/p><p>Each week you\u2019ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We\u2019re looking forward to working with you.<\/p><div><br><\/div>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<span><p>Introduction to Computational Arts: Processing<br>Jan 2014<br>Consortium for Digital Arts & Technology (CDACT)<br>Stony Brook University and Coursera<\/p><h2>COURSE INFORMATION <\/h2><h2>Instructors<\/h2><p>Dr. Margaret Schedel & Timothy Vallier<\/p><p>Course Description<\/p><p>This multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to, and exploration of electronic media in the arts.
