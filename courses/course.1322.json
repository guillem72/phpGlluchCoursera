    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>In this 5-week course we’ll introduce the fundamentals of programming. This is the first part of a class which has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. The other two portions are Introduction to Computational Arts: Image Manipulation and Introduction to Computational Arts: Sound Art.<\/p><p>For programming we’ll be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.<\/p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and an artistic project, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We’ll cover the history of generative  art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.<\/p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data.<\/p><p>Additionally, you’ll create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art.  <\/p><p>Each week you’ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We’re looking forward to working with you.<\/p><div><br><\/div>",

You can only take these quizzes ONCE. We are using this MOOC to flip the classroom and we do not give our students multiple chances. <\/p><p> There are also “in-video questions,” and you must answer these questions correctly in order to advance the video, but these questions are NOT graded, you can re-do the “in-video” quiz as many times as you need to.<\/p><p>Assignments<\/p><p>Assignments are purely technical; each module will include a detailed explanation of how to complete and grade each assignment. There will be one assignment (which may have multiple components)  every week that there is no project due.  Each assignment should take you no more than one hour.<\/p><br><p>Project<\/p><p>The final project is both aesthetic and technical; there will be an explanation of how to grade the project but you must remember that art is subjective. You can expect the project to take at  least 4 hours to complete. <\/p><p>Disclaimer: “The course schedule, policies, procedures, and assignments in this course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, and\/or to ensure better student learning.”<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>COURSE SCHEDULE<\/b><\/p><p>Week 1 Introduction to Computing and Processing<br>Week 2 Drawing in Processing: Arguments, Functions, and Primitives<br>Week 3 Dynamic Drawing: Code blocks, text, and loops.<br>Week 4 External Input and Interactive Sketches<br>Week 5 Sound, Images, and Publishing<\/p><\/span>",
