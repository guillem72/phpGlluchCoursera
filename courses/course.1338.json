The basis of this \ndiscussion will be a short video and reading each week. The videos are of master teachers in real \nclasses around the world, providing a look into the international \ncommunity of EFL teachers. Closed captioning helps you understand what the teachers\n and students are saying. <\/p><p>Each week, a reading on methods and teaching practices, written by teachers for\n teachers, adds perspective to the classroom \nvideos. To\n share ideas about each week\u2019s topics with others, you are invited to \njoin discussion forums. In the discussions, you can contribute to the \ndialogue: Find out what other teachers do in their classes, ask \nquestions, share and gain insights into classroom practice. These \ndiscussions will also help you formulate the culminating project.<\/p>For\n the culminating project, you will write a lesson plan incorporating \nsome of the ideas from your readings, videos, and \nconversations with others. The project will build over the 5 weeks of \nthe course, resulting in a practical, well-designed lesson that will \ndemonstrate an understanding of the course material, and be truly \nmeaningful for your students. As part of the project, you will read \nothers\u2019 lesson plans and offer constructive criticism. This peer \nreviewing activity will heighten \nyour awareness of others\u2019 assumptions about teaching and give you a \nwindow into how English learning proceeds in other cultures. With the \npeer reviews, you will also build a repertoire of completed lessons to \nshare and experiment with. <br><p>As you watch and read and discuss, we hope you\u2019ll build your \ncreativity and flexibility as a teacher.
