The burden upon individuals in terms of ongoing pain and suffering is incalculable.<\/p><p>Consider an alternative. By using a human systems approach, we can better understand how individual risk factors in the cognitive, behavioral, physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental realms of our lives can interact to perpetuate chronic pain and, if improved, can prevent it. &nbsp;<\/p><p>During this course, you will: Identify the problems of our health care system in dealing with chronic pain.
