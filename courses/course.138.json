Why do we have so much pollution? Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime? Why is a college education a smart investment, or is it? Why would a draft only damage the army? In the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the most interesting and important questions for humanity!","aboutTheCourse":"<p>This course offers an <strong>introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers<\/strong>\u2014both consumers and producers\u2014within the larger economic system. Emphasis is on the nature and functions of <strong>product markets<\/strong>, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of <strong>competition and monopoly<\/strong>, and the <strong>role of government<\/strong> in promoting efficiency in the economy.<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/microecon\/images\/microecon3.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 5px; width:270px;\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Most people make the <strong>incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study of money<\/strong>.  My primary goal in this course is to <strong>shatter this belief<\/strong>. During this course, we will be addressing the above questions as well as many more relating to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the environment<\/li>\n<li>love and marriage<\/li>\n<li>crime<\/li>\n<li>labor markets<\/li>\n<li>education<\/li>\n<li>politics<\/li>\n<li>sports<\/li>\n<li>business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>My main goal is to show you <strong>the way economists think<\/strong> and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related not only to these and other <strong>important human issues<\/strong>, but to anything you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will quickly find out, <strong>I believe that everything is economics!<\/strong><\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p>This course will be broken up into 8 modules covering the following topics:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/microecon\/images\/microecon2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0; width:270px;\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Module 1: <\/strong>Basic Concepts, Modeling, and Trade<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;2: <\/strong>Supply and Demand<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;3: <\/strong>Market Efficiency and Government Intervention<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;4: <\/strong>Elasticity and Taxes<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;5: <\/strong>Production and Costs<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;6: <\/strong>Competitive Output<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;7: <\/strong>Firms With Market Power<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;8: <\/strong>Public Goods, Common Resources, and Externalities<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","courseFormat":"<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/microecon\/images\/microecon1.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 5px; width:270px;\" alt=\"\">\n<p>In addition to watching <strong>multiple 5<\/strong><strong><strong>\u201315 minute long <\/strong>video lectures<\/strong> each week, you can participate in the following activities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1 for-credit quiz<\/strong> per module<\/li>\n<li><strong>practice<\/strong> quizzes<\/li>\n<li><strong>discussion<\/strong> activities<\/li>","suggestedReadings":"<p>Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we <strong>recommend (but do not require)<\/strong> that you refer to the text: Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. <i>Microeconomics<\/i>. 3rd ed.
