    "shortDescription": "Why is Coursera offering this course free of charge? Why is the divorce rate so high? Why do we have so much pollution? Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime? Why is a college education a smart investment, or is it? Why would a draft only damage the army? In the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the most interesting and important questions for humanity!",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>This course offers an <strong>introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers<\/strong>—both consumers and producers—within the larger economic system. Emphasis is on the nature and functions of <strong>product markets<\/strong>, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of <strong>competition and monopoly<\/strong>, and the <strong>role of government<\/strong> in promoting efficiency in the economy.<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/microecon\/images\/microecon3.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 5px; width:270px;\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Most people make the <strong>incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study of money<\/strong>.  My primary goal in this course is to <strong>shatter this belief<\/strong>. During this course, we will be addressing the above questions as well as many more relating to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the environment<\/li>\n<li>love and marriage<\/li>\n<li>crime<\/li>\n<li>labor markets<\/li>\n<li>education<\/li>\n<li>politics<\/li>\n<li>sports<\/li>\n<li>business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>My main goal is to show you <strong>the way economists think<\/strong> and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related not only to these and other <strong>important human issues<\/strong>, but to anything you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will quickly find out, <strong>I believe that everything is economics!<\/strong><\/p>",
