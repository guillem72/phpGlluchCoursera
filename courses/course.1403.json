    "shortDescription": "This course covers chemicals in our environment and in our bodies and how they impact our health. It addresses policies and practices related to chemicals, particularly related to how they get into our bodies (exposures), what they do when they get there (toxicology), how we measure them (biomonitoring) and their impact on our health.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p><i><\/i>Chemicals make up every part of us! Some chemicals are vital\nto our health, while others may be harmful. This course focuses on the\npotentially harmful effects of some of the many chemicals we encounter every\nday, with particular attention to measuring our exposures to these chemicals.<\/p>\n\n<p>While personal care products, food packaging and other\nconsumer conveniences have greatly improved our quality of life, they have also\nintroduced the opportunity for exposures to many new and not-well-understood chemicals.\nStudies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC)\nNational Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, confirm that\nwidely-used chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and flame retardants are\nroutinely found in human blood or urine. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of this course, students will better understand\nchemicals in the environment, exposure, toxicology, biomonitoring, and related\npublic health and policy implications.<\/p>\n<br>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.",
