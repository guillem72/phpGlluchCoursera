    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>The average American is now at least three generations\nremoved from production agriculture.&nbsp;\nThis leads to the disconnection between how the public views agriculture\nand how scientists and producers view it, resulting in consumer distrust of\nscience and commercial food production.&nbsp;\nIt is this lack of trust which leads to consumer confusion and the urge\nto grasp at multiple solutions.&nbsp; However\na growing number of consumers in developed countries are aspiring to “know\nwhere their food comes from”.&nbsp; Animal agriculture\nneeds to explain the technology which will be used to sustainably feed 9\nbillion people by 2050. <\/p>\n\nLectures will cover all aspects of muscle foods production,\nprocessing, preparation, cooking and storage.&nbsp;\nAdditionally, the role of muscle foods in a balanced diet will be\naddressed as will issues which contribute to consumers limiting or eliminating\nmeat from their diets.",
