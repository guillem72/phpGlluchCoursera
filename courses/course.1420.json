    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>In this 5-week course we’ll introduce the fundamentals of digital audio. This is the final third of a class which has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. The other two portions have already been taught this spring, but we will offer them again in the fall: &nbsp; Introduction to Computational Arts: Image Manipulation and Introduction to Computational Arts: Processing.<\/p><p>For sound we’ll be Logic or a combination of Audacity and Soundation. Students can use other Digital Audio Workstations such as Reaper or Ableton Live. The course will provide the essentials of digital audio&nbsp;and culminates with a piece using both recorded and synthesized sound.&nbsp;<\/p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and an artistic project, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. This course is more about recording and sound art than about writing traditional music - I will give examples of work which doesn't require a background in traditional music to create.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with audio.<\/p><p>Additionally, you’ll create an online portfolio of digital sound projects, and be able to communicate ideas about aesthetics. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Each week you’ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. The practice videos are divided by software platforms. &nbsp;There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We’re looking forward to working with you.<\/p><div><br><\/div>",
