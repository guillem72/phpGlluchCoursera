    "shortDescription": "This course provides students an understanding of important human parasitic diseases, including their life cycles, vectors of transmission, distribution and epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention and control.  ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "\"Tropical Parasitology: Protozoans, Worms, Vectors and Human Diseases\" will present information on important human parasites. The specific parasites for discussion include malaria, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, cestodes (<i>Taenia saginata<\/i>, <i>Taenia solium<\/i>, and <i>Echinococcus<\/i>), trematodes (<i>Schistosoma<\/i> and <i>Fasciola<\/i>), nematodes (<i>Ancylostoma\/Necator<\/i>, <i>Strongyloides<\/i>, filariasis, and <i>Ascaris<\/i>), and ectoparasites. An emphasis will be placed on field demonstrations of relevance in sub-Saharan Africa and clinical presentations of parasitic illness, including their life cycles, vectors of transmission, distribution and \nepidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, treatment, \nand prevention and control. <br>",
