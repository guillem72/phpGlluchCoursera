You will learn to analyse, synthesize and transform sounds using the Python programming language.","aboutTheCourse":"Audio signal processing is an engineering field that focuses on the computational methods for intentionally altering sounds, methods that are used in many musical applications.<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>We have put together a course that can be of\ninterest and accessible to people coming from diverse backgrounds while going\ndeep into several signal processing topics.
