{"id":1487,"shortName":"sanitation","name":"Planning & Design of Sanitation Systems and Technologies ","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn more about how to plan for urban sanitation at city and local\/community levels, different sanitation system and technology configurations and examples of successful and failed urban sanitation systems in low- and middle-income countries.\n","aboutTheCourse":"Sanitation is one of\nthe most off-track MDGs and progress in urban sanitation is proving especially\ndifficult to achieve. The traditional response for\nimproving urban sanitation is typically based on a master planning approach\nwhich has widely failed to meet the needs of low-income communities living in\nslums, who cannot afford to pay the expected charges for service improvements. <br><p>In this course you will learn how to plan for affordable and context-specific\nsanitation solutions using some state-of-the-art sector planning tools and frameworks\nsuch as Sanitation 21, Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) and\nthe Sanitation Systems Approach. By using exercises and concrete examples,\nparticipants will learn how to choose appropriate sanitation systems and\ntechnologies for a variety of urban contexts.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is the 2nd MOOC of the series on \"Sanitation, Water and Solid Waste for Development\", which is an\ninitiative of <a title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.sandec.ch\/index_EN\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sandec.ch\/index_EN\">Sandec\/Eawag<\/a>\nand <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/moocs.epfl.ch\/mooc-factory\">EPFL<\/a>.\nSandec\/Eawag develops and offers the series as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/collaboratingcentres\/en\/\">WHO\nCollaborating Centre<\/a>.
