We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.\n    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the\n    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.<\/p>\n<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize\n    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically\n    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical\n    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in\n    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important\n    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility\n    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive\n    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications\n    of the field.<\/p>","courseSyllabus":"","courseFormat":"","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Michael Genesereth","estimatedClassWorkload":"4-10 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"","links":{}}
