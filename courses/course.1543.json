    "shortDescription": "In the United States, two-thirds of the population read at an eight-grade level or below. When it comes to health information, most Americans have the ability to read and write at the fifth-grade level.  This inter-professional course aims to give health professionals the tools needed to improve upon their health literacy and communication skills.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>This\ninter-professional course will help educate a variety of health professionals\nabout health literacy efforts and improved communication skills. It will\nrequire your active participation in creating health literate interactions at\nvarious organizational levels. This course will provide the opportunity to\nreinforce existing opportunities to work together as a multidisciplinary team\nor fill a gap if you haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet! <\/p>\n\n<p>Upon completion\nof the course, you will be able to:<\/p>\n\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Define health literacy and how it applies to all health disciplines.&nbsp;<\/p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; List the varied factors that influence health literacy and health communication.&nbsp;<\/p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Identify who is affected by health literacy and health communication.&nbsp;<\/p><p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Recognize the consequences of limited health literacy and poor health communication.&nbsp;<\/p><p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Determine the stakeholders in health literacy and health communication.&nbsp;<\/p><p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; Recognize the role of health literacy in meeting core health service across disciplines.&nbsp;<\/p><p>7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apply strategies to improve health literacy at the group, organizational, community, and policy levels<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to these\ncourse objectives, it is key to the success of the student that participants\nunderstand their responsibilities of working as a part of an inter-professional\nhealth care team. The basis of patient-centered care and the foundation of the\nmedical home model is that health professionals will learn and implement skills\nto meet the community’s health needs in the context of the community’s daily\nlives—which is their reality! That includes recognizing the social determinants\nof health, such as complex social, economic, environmental, and political\nfactors, that impact both the public’s wellness and their health literacy, too.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>One initial\nstep – a recommended prerequisite to beginning this online course – is to first\ncomplete the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s self-directed online\ntraining, “Health Literacy for Public Health Professionals”. It\nprovides a good foundation about health literacy in three brief, interactive\nlessons which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete. <\/p>\n\n<p>We are also\nusing the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy discussion\npaper, “Ten Attributes of Health Literate Health Care Organizations” as a guide. &nbsp;This online course will assist its participants in understanding that health\nliteracy needs to be an organizational value and embraced as part of the\norganization’s core business.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n<p>A phrase that we often like to use is “help a person connect the dots”. By this we mean we\nneed to make sure that understanding of health information exists. An example\nof this would be thinking if someone is advised they need to take a\nmedication, or told they need to change daily choices and behaviors\nto improve health that it will simply happen as directed. But, there are\nmany necessary steps, strategies, and skills in communication for the advice being given to actually happen. &nbsp;Often, current health\nprofessionals and health care settings often assume that “one size fits all”\nwhen it comes to communicating health messages. &nbsp;This course will focus on\nsome approaches to becoming a health literate health care organization by using\nscenarios with actors based on patient experiences, by also letting patients\nshare their experiences in their own words, and by offering suggestions\nfor improvement in health communication.<\/p>\n\n<p>We hope you join us and become an agent of change both in your own discipline and as a\nmember of an inter-professional team in health care organizations going\nforward!<\/p>",
