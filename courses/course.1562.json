    "shortDescription": "What happens when creativity and science come together?  The power to design our world is unleashed, providing tools to inform choices about how we live!  Geodesign is the glue—it’s a process that deploys creativity to connect information to people, using collaboration to better inform how we design our world.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Our world is awash in facts and information,\nwhich are now easily accessible.&nbsp; So why\nare so many bad decisions being made?&nbsp;\nWhat is needed is creativity and design that brings those facts to life\n– to create a vision and choices as well as an understanding about the\npotential impacts of those choices.&nbsp; The\ngeodesign process has evolved over nearly 40 years and now combines the core\nconcepts of design thinking with the latest in geo-spatial technologies.<br><br>Geodesign is a proven form of design that\nuses techniques and practices from a multitude of professions to determine\noptimal ways to design for complex land use challenges. It is a collaborative\nprocess that capitalizes on the strengths of people with a variety of expertise\nto create and implement unique models to aid in the design decision-making\nprocess.<br><br>Our MOOC will introduce the average person to\nthe core concepts of geodesign through real-world examples which showcase how\ngeodesign has worked across the globe. &nbsp;People\nfrom all walks of life with interests in science, design, sustainability and\nenvironmental stewardship will want to learn about geodesign. &nbsp;Together we will explore how anyone can use\nthe geodesign process to work with others to effect change in their world.",
