{"id":1565,"shortName":"wrongfulconviction","name":"Presumed Innocent? The Social Science of Wrongful Conviction","language":"en","shortDescription":"The United States criminal justice system is typically an accurate and efficient system\u2014although, as a human creation, it is not perfect. This course will employ a social scientific perspective to understand why innocent people are sometimes convicted of crimes they did not commit. In this course we will discuss wrongful convictions, their causes, and their solutions.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>According to\nthe National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of Michigan Law and\nNorthwestern Law, over 1,600 individuals in the United States have been\nexonerated after being convicted for crimes they did not commit. These are the\nknown cases of wrongful conviction\u2014the actual number is much higher. Some of\nthese individuals have served years, even decades, in prison for these\ncrimes. Often, real offenders\nhave escaped justice as a result of the wrong person being accused and convicted. <\/p>\n\n<p>As noted, we\nwill approach this topic from a social scientific perspective. Social science\nis a broad field that seeks to understand social interactions between\nindividuals, groups, and institutions. The field includes academic disciplines\nsuch as sociology, criminology, psychology, economics, anthropology, political\nscience, and other related disciplines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In this\ncourse we will explore wrongful convictions answering several key questions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><i>What do we mean by\n     \u201cwrongfully convicted,\u201d and how common are wrongful convictions?<\/i><\/li>\n <li><i>Who are wrongfully\n     convicted?<\/i><\/li>\n <li><i>Where in the\n     criminal justice system do things go wrong to lead to wrongful\n     convictions?<\/i><\/li>\n <li><i>Why do wrongful\n     convictions occur? <\/i><\/li>\n <li><i>How can social\n     science contribute to understanding, and preventing wrongful convictions?<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><h2>For-credit option:<\/h2><p>This course will also be offered for Penn State credit.
