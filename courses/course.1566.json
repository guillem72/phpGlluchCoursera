    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>The course is\nabout the encounter between the literary imagination and a continent, a hugely\ndiverse land that is home to some of the oldest surviving Indigenous cultures\non the planet, and whose history includes defining and sometimes violent\nencounters between the old world and the new. In Aboriginal culture, in early\nEuropean encounters, and in later white settlement, we see how the haunting and\nawe-inspiring landscapes of Australia have shaped and influenced a fascinating\nworld of literature.<\/p><p>This course\nintroduces you to a varied range of Australian literary works, beginning with\nIndigenous traditions and including colonial, early twentieth-century and\ncontemporary writing. The texts for study include works of local and regional\nfocus and others that engage with the wider world; some are classic works, some\nare popular.<\/p><p>The course\noffers a rough guide to some of the traditions and themes of Australian\nwriting. Our starting point is the country, and each of the four main weeks\nfocuses on different literary versions of a place, a landscape, or locale.\nPerspectives on the literary works is from both inside and outside, from within\nthe traditions of writing in Australia and from a global view.<\/p><p>There are\ntales of the deep time of Aboriginal creation in central Australia, of first\ncontact between Europeans and the fabled southern continent, of crime and\npunishment, of gold-seeking and spiritual quest, of tragedies in the desert, of\nfamilies divided between the southern and northern hemispheres, of expatriate\nlives. All across a range of songs, fiction, poetry, popular legend and\nnon-fiction. Throughout the journey of this course we follow the ways writers\nhave adapted their language and narrative to the Australian environment and its\nhistory.<\/p><br><br>",
