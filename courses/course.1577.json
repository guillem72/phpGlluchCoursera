In this course we critically examine a range of ideas around education: including learning, teaching and schooling. Our aim is to consider what our preferred future for education might look like.","aboutTheCourse":"<span>The course aims to get you to\ncritically examine your own ideas about education, teaching and learning. The\ncritique will be developed through engagement with&nbsp;theories\nand ideas developed through educational research. You will be encouraged to use these ideas to challenge or support your own ideas about education.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><\/span><p>Each week we will focus on one key question, using video lectures, key readings and challenges to explore some commonplace notions about education. With the guidance of the course team, you will be asked to use these ideas to critically reflect on your own understandings and experience. By the end of the course, you will have developed a personal response\nto the main question: what is your preferred future for education?<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Announcement for US based teachers:<\/strong><br><\/p><p><em>Coursera and its partners are proud to offer eligible teachers&nbsp;<\/em><b><u><em>free verified certificates<\/em><\/u><\/b><em>&nbsp;for this course and other high-quality teacher professional development courses, through the ConnectED effort announced by President Obama.<\/em><\/p><p><em>To participate in this opportunity, district leaders simply need to approve Coursera teacher professional development by completing a brief form at:&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coursera.org\/tpd\"><em>www.coursera.org\/tpd<\/em><\/a><u><em>.<\/em><\/u><\/p><p><em>Teachers interested in this opportunity are also encouraged to follow the link to learn more and<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1t7G3eSUuWvX3arzktgyuzHhMR188D0YnVT-T_aT2pgQ\/viewform\"><em>&nbsp;complete the form<\/em><\/a><em>. &nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><em>Once a district\u2019s form has been verified, the district leader will be notified and teachers in the district will receive access to free verified certificates for Coursera professional development.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Coursera and its partners thank educators for the hard work they do every day and hope this opportunity will allow them to continue developing their craft in a meaningful and flexible way.<\/em><\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p><b>Week 1&nbsp;<\/b><b>-<\/b><b>&nbsp;How do we learn? &nbsp;<\/b>This week we explore the&nbsp;learning approach of the\n  course, and start to question what \"learning\" means. &nbsp;Through exploring different models of learning you will gain an understanding of different approaches to, and perspectives on learning.<\/p>\n   <span>\n  <p><b>Week 2 - What is intelligence and does it matter?&nbsp;<\/b>The focus this week is to challenge popular ideas around intelligence.
