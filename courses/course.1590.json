    "aboutTheCourse": "This course invites students to synthesize their learning from the three courses in the Specialization into one final project on a topic of their own choice.&nbsp;Each student will choose a controversial topic and write an&nbsp;essay (1,500 - 2,000 words) in which they use their analysis of&nbsp;data to argue for their own position about that topic. This written argument will analyze data and draw statistical inferences, as well as engage with other evidence in the form of visual and\/or written texts. Students will be asked to develop their project in stages, working from concept to data analysis to argument draft to final project, and will give and receive multiple rounds of peer review to hone their product.&nbsp;<br><br>The Final Project Course will run three times throughout the year.<br>",
