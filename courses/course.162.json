Because in most\ncases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a\npoor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no\nsurprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition\nand sufficient physical activity is imperative.\n<br>\n<br>This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge\nto develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added\na foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These\ntwo key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella\nof calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories\nthat we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life\nand to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.\n<br>\n<br>Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand\nhow to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when\nthey are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key\nissues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting\nand maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption\nand maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.\n<br>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"There are no required textbooks for this course.
