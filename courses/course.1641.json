It is the document and the principles that make one nation and\none people out of the several states. But where did it come from? How has it\nchanged over the years? How do we know what it means?<\/p>\n\n<p>This\ncourse, which launches shortly after Constitution Day, explores those questions. It examines the Constitution\u2019s origins, the\nproblems the Framers confronted and the solutions they adopted. It follows the\nConstitution\u2019s changes over the years, from the initial burst of amendments\nthat brought us the Bill of Rights, through the bloody disruption of the Civil\nWar, and into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It discusses landmark\nSupreme Court cases that show how the Framers\u2019 ideas have fared in the modern\nworld.<\/p>\n\n<p>The\ncourse provides a broad overview of the Constitution, including both the\nstructure and powers of the federal government and individual rights topics.\nCases discussed include Brown v. Board of Education, Gideon v. Wainwright,\nMiranda v. Arizona, Roe v. Wade, Korematsu v. United States, District of\nColumbia v. Heller, and NFIB v.
