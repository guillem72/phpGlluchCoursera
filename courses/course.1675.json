As an illustration of the questions we will raise (and hopefully answer) during the course, consider the following:<\/p>\n<div><ul>\n<li>What are mean returns, volatility, and beta? These essential concepts, widely used in the financial press, are the very first step in your journey into the financial world. We will discuss them in our first session, <strong>Risk and Return.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><ul><li>What is a correlation? How is correlation related to diversification? Why is diversification at the heart of portfolio construction? This is a critical issue for investors and portfolio managers, and you simply cannot build a proper portfolio if you ignore them. We will discuss these and related issues in our second session, <strong>Correlation and Diversification.<\/strong><\/li><br>\n<li>How does a company estimate the required return on its debt? And the required return on its equity? And, ultimately, its cost of capital? What is the usefulness of these concepts? We will discuss these and related issues in our third session, <strong>The CAPM and the Cost of Capital.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><ul>\n<li>Understanding the cost of capital and its components is essential, but can you put theory into practice? Can you estimate the cost of capital for a specific company? You can and we will discuss how in our fourth session, <strong>Estimating the Cost of Capital \u2013 An Application.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><ul>\n<li>How do companies separate the projects on which they should invest from those on which they should not?

Risk and Return<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this session we will discuss some basic but essential financial concepts such as mean return, volatility, and beta.

The CAPM and the Cost of Capital<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this session we will discuss how companies assess their cost of debt, their cost of equity, and ultimately their cost of capital.
