    "shortDescription": "Knowledge linking genomics to health and disease is rapidly expanding.  Translation of this knowledge into clinical and public health practice offers promising opportunities but also raises a host of ethical, legal, social, and policy questions.  Using case examples, this inter-disciplinary course will explore the challenges of genomic and precision medicine.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>This seven week, inter-disciplinary course provides an\nintroduction to ethical, legal, social, and policy issues that arise in the\ntranslation of genomic knowledge into medical and public health practice. It\nconsiders challenges in health related and reproductive testing\/screening\nfocusing on six specific areas:&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPre-conception genetic diagnosis, and prenatal\ntesting\/screening<\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nNewborn screening <\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUse of genomic sequencing technologies to diagnose\nand predict disease<\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTargeting genomic testing\/screening by\nrace\/ethnicity.<\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDirect-to-consumer genomic testing\/screening<\/p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUse of “big data” for genomic research and genomic\ntranslation <\/p>\n\nThe course uses case studies to illustrate key\nthemes in genomic translation. Students will have an opportunity to interrogate\nand critique a promising science through lectures and readings from a range of\ndisciplinary perspectives (e.g. history, sociology, genetics, medicine,\nbioethics) and online discussion.<br><br>This course may be of particular interest to students who completed Jeanette McCarthy and Robert Nussbaum's Genomic and Precision Medicine course (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/genomicmedicine\" title=\"Link: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/genomicmedicine\">https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/genomicmedicine<\/a>), which will be&nbsp;offered by UCSF for a second time&nbsp;on Coursera starting March 16.<br><br><br><br>",
