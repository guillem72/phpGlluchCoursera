We evaluate the scientific rigour\nof studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods\nadopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.<\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<div><b>We will cover the&nbsp;following topics:<\/b><\/div><ul><li>Behaviour, Ecology and Natural Selection<\/li><li>Genes, Environment and Learning<\/li><li>Finding food and avoiding predators<\/li><li>Communication<\/li><li>Sexual selection and sperm competition<\/li><li>Mating systems and sex allocation<br><\/li><li>Parental care and conflict<\/li><li>Social behaviour<\/li><\/ul>","courseFormat":"<div>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks of 10-15 minutes in duration (total lecture video content per week 1-1.5 hours). &nbsp;In addition to the weekly lecture videos, there will be a number of \u2018researcher meets\u2019, where students can interact with current researchers in animal behaviour in a live video discussion forum.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The lecture videos contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video (which are not graded). &nbsp;There are weekly graded homeworks, which take the form of multiple choice quizzes, and a peer-graded writing assignment.<\/div>","suggestedReadings":"<div><div>There are no required readings for this course.<br><\/div><\/div>","instructor":"Raoul Mulder and Mark Elgar","estimatedClassWorkload":"6-8 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"Apart from enthusiasm for animal behaviour, there is no background required for this course.","links":{}}
