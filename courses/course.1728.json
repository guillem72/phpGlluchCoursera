This is because U.S. online\nenvironments tend to be based on American culture and American ways of doing\nthings. This may make even ordinary things confusing to non-Americans abroad.\nIn order to better understand and master American eLearning and other U.S.\nvirtual environments, international students and foreign-born professionals\nneed to know how American universities and companies use the Internet to\norganize work and study, develop and execute projects, communicate ideas,\ncollaborate and solve organizational and technical problems. By taking this\ncourse, you will learn how to enhance your cultural knowledge and assess\npotential skill gaps that may hinder your online experience or negatively\nimpact your performance in U.S. virtual work environments. Throughout the\ncourse you will systematically review competencies required for online work, come\nto better understand common barriers for non-native students and professionals\nin U.S. virtual work environments, learn about effective strategies and develop\nplans for self-improvement<\/p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be able to:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nRecognize six key competency areas (domains)\nthat you should better understand in order to master American eLearning and\nU.S. virtual work environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nFor each competency area, you\u2019ll systematically\nreview and examine required levels of proficiency in terms of awareness,\nknowledge, skills and attitudes.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nExamine how gaps in awareness, knowledge, skills\nand attitudes can cause barriers to learning and work performance in American\neLearning and other U.S.-style virtual environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIdentify and explore effective strategies, best\npractices, skill-building techniques and helpful resources that can be used to\neliminate gaps and alleviate barriers; discuss those with peers across the\nglobe.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSelf-assess your perceived level of mastery in\nvarious levels of competencies, identify gaps in your awareness, knowledge,\nskills and attitudes and develop personal strategies for improvement.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAs a result, perform more effectively in\nAmerican eLearning and U.S. virtual work environments, develop self-directed\nlearning skills and enhance employability skills.<\/p>\n\n<p>The course can be used in a variety of ways.
