    "shortDescription": "Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p><b><\/b>While the human genome sequence has\ntransformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of\nyour DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated\nand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research\nover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control\ncontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable\nthrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to\nmutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,\nepigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be\nmanipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that\nepigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),\nwhich has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course will give an introduction to the\nfundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that\nare manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on\nmammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the\nenvironment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.<\/p>",
