    "shortDescription": "This course introduces students to the basic components of electronics: diodes, transistors, and op amps.  It covers the basic operation and some common applications.  ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "This course is a basic overview of electronic components and their common uses. &nbsp;It covers diodes, transistors, and op amps. &nbsp;Laboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from the lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific or technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The coverage is not as deep as an electronics course aimed at electrical or computer engineers. There are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course that serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience.&nbsp;",
