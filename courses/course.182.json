    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Tissue Engineering is a rapidly expanding field of applied biology and\n    biomedical engineering that aims to create artificial organs for transplantation,\n    basic research, or drug development. A fascinating aspect of the field\n    is the fundamental need to integrate knowledge of organic chemistry, cell\n    biology, genetics, mechanics and transport processes to create functional\n    organs. The process uncovers the fascinating complexity of living tissues,\n    and the joy of creation. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This course will review basic cell culture techniques, structure function\n    relationships, cellular communication, natural and artificial biomaterials,\n    and the basic equations governing cell survival and tissue organization.&nbsp;<\/p>",
