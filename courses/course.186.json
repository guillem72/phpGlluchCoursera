    "shortDescription": "Learn about the physiological responses to acute and chronic exercise and their relevance for athletic performance.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "This course examines the physiological responses to acute and chronic exercise, with a focus on skeletal muscle, energy metabolism, the oxygen transport system and temperature and fluid balance.  The factors that limit exercise performance will be reviewed and the role of genes in determining athletic performance will be considered.  At the end of this course, you should have a better understanding of the athlete within!<br>",
