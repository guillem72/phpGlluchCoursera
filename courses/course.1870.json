    "shortDescription": "Learn about acoustics by using the concept of impedance. Following part 1, radiation, scattering, and diffraction are studied. Wave propagation in closed space is also covered. Leads to understand essentials as well to cover graduate level topics. ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<div>This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. In the previous part, the course starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibration can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. They are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide mathematically simplest but clear enough physical insights. Then the part 1 ends with explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.&nbsp;<\/div><div>Following the part 1, part 2 starts with radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space.&nbsp;<\/div><div>This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome. For the continuity of the lecture, taking part 1 of the course is recommended (but not required).&nbsp;<\/div>",
