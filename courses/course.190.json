The course emphasizes the\necological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple\nnatural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the\nhealth of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and\ndemographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to\nunderstand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts\nof disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing\ndisease.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students in the course will explore successful examples in\npublic health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies\nhave both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How\nsocioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk\nintervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and\ncollective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of\nhealth. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide\ndiscoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the\nglobal level.<\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<i><b>Week One<\/b><\/i><b>: <\/b>What is Public Health?<br><i><b>Week Two<\/b><\/i><b>: <\/b>The Role of Data in Public Health <br><i><b>Week Three<\/b><\/i><b>: <\/b>The Biomedical Basis of Public Health<br><i><b>Week Four<\/b><\/i><b> :<\/b> Do People Choose Their Own Health?<br><i><b>Week Five:<\/b><\/i><b>&nbsp; <\/b>The Future of Public Health","courseFormat":"The course consists of video presentations, peer interactions, opportunities for discussion of public health topics, and a peer-assessed research paper prepared as a screencast.<br>","suggestedReadings":"<i><a href=\"http:\/\/chggtrx.com\/click.track?CID=267582&AFID=301076&ADID=1088031&SID=publichealth&isbn_ean=9780763763817\">Introduction to Public Health<\/a>,&nbsp;<\/i>Mary-Jane Schneider, 3rd edition, \n2011, Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 40 Tall Pine Drive, Sudbury, MA \n01776, ISBN: 0-7637-6381-0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jbpub.com\">www.jbpub.com<\/a><br><br><i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Public-Health-Career-Choices-Difference\/dp\/0763737909\/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348030118&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=13%3A+978-0-7637-3790-0\">Public Health - Career Choices That Make a Difference<\/a><\/i>, Bernard J. \nTurnock, 2006 Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 40 Tall Pine Drive, \nSudbury, MA 01776, ISBN - 13: 978-0-7637-3790-0<br><br>Additional Resources and Reading Resources:<br>The American Journal of Public Health&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajph.org\">www.ajph.org<\/a><br>The Nation's Health&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thenationshealth.org\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.thenationshealth.org\">www.thenationshealth.org<\/a><br>World Federation of Public Health Associations <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wfpha.org\">www.wfpha.org<\/a><br>World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\">www.who.int<\/a><br>United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unicef.org\">www.unicef.org<\/a><br>Global Health Council <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalhealth.org\">www.globalhealth.org<\/a><br>African Council for Sustainable Health Development (ACOSHED) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acoshed.net\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.acoshed.net\">www.acoshed.net<\/a><br>Association of Schools of Public Health <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asph.org\">www.asph.org<\/a><br>Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aspher.org\">www.aspher.org<\/a><br>Latin American and Caribbean Association of Education in Public Health <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alaesp.sld.cu\/html\/informe.htm\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.alaesp.sld.cu\/html\/informe.htm\">www.alaesp.sld.cu\/html\/informe.htm<\/a><br>Asia Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apacph.org\">www.apacph.org<\/a><br>Public Health archives:<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/tocrender.fcgi?journal=333&amp;action=archive\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/tocrender.fcgi?journal=333&amp;action=archive\">http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/tocrender.fcgi?journal=333&amp;action=archive<\/a><br>Journals in Public Health:<br><a href=\"http:\/\/jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org\">http:\/\/jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eurpub.oxfordjournals.org\/\">http:\/\/eurpub.oxfordjournals.org\/<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eurpub.oxfordjournals.org\/reports\/mfr1.dtl\">http:\/\/eurpub.oxfordjournals.org\/reports\/mfr1.dtl<\/a><br><br>","instructor":"Zuzana Bic","estimatedClassWorkload":"6-8 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"Proficiency through college preparatory high school curriculum including two years of biology, a combination of natural science courses including one year each of mathematics and chemistry, and courses in health science and social sciences are recommended. <br>","links":{}}
