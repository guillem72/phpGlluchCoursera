    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>In\nthis course we will discuss how theatre, a European cultural practice, spread\nrapidly around the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The modules\nwill engage with both theoretical and historical perspectives on what is a\nrelatively new area of theatrical research. Globalisation is a highly controversial\nconcept that has provoked extreme reactions. It also tends to be discussed as a\nphenomenon post-dating the end of the Cold War in 1989. In this course we will\nargue that globalization, even as we understand it today, in fact goes back at\nleast to the mid- to late 19th century when the existence of colonial empires\ncreated the conditions for mass migration, the rapid transportation of goods and\npeople, the invention of new technologies such as steam shipping, railways and\ntelegraphy, which all helped to facilitate the spread of theatre. We will\nengage with research that has emerged in the context of global and\ntransnational history and apply these findings to theatre. We will look at how\ncertain plays, operas and ballets quite literally went global. We will look at\ntheatre buildings, at the cosmopolitan audiences that emerged as well as the\nactors, agents and managers who facilitated the movement of theatre around the\nworld. The final two modules will focus on the post-1945 and 1989 developments,\neach of which represent globalisation of different kinds.<\/p>",
