Laws governing who may enter the country, the conditions of entry, and actions that may result in deportation will occupy the remainder of the course. This week we examine the history of U.S. immigration. Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 1880's, U.S. law has at times discriminated against specific racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, the most important constitutional law doctrines governing U.S. immigration law solidified during those eras. The modern constitutional doctrine of \"plenary power\" is introduced here.<\/p><ul><li>Myths and Realities of an \"Open Border\" Past<\/li><li>The Chinese Exclusion Acts and the U.S. Supreme Court<\/li><li>The \"Plenary Power\" Doctrine in U.S. Constitutional Law<\/li><li>Modern Structure: Federal Agencies and Courts<\/li><li>The Faces of Immigration Today: Numbers<\/li><\/ul><h2>Week 3: Eligibility for Immigration, Part I<\/h2><p>This week we will consider the requirements for legal immigration to the U.S. These come in the form of general criteria applicable to all who seek to enter (e.g., no criminal history, not likely to become a \"public charge\"), as well as specific requirements for an entry visa and the \"green card\" -- permission to remain in the United States indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident.<\/p><div><ul><li>Requirements for Entry:\u00a0 Introduction to the Grounds of Inadmissibility<\/li><li>Inadmissibility Based on Immigration Control<\/li><li>Inadmissibility Based on National Security<\/li><li>Inadmissibility Based on Criminal Acts<\/li><li>Inadmissibility Based on Public Health<\/li><li>Inadmissibility on Economic Grounds<\/li><li>Procedures to Determine Admissibility<br><\/li><\/ul><\/div><h2>Week 4: Eligibility for Immigration, Part II<\/h2><p>Week four continues our examination of eligibility for non-U.S. citizens to enter or remain in the country. This week focuses more closely on categories of immigrants -- guest workers, business employees, and family members, as well as temporary visitors such as students and tourists. Along with border security, these visa categories are at the center of current debates over immigration reform, given that the waiting time for some persons eligible to immigrate to the United States can reach decades. Recent proposals for immigration reform are noted here.<\/p><ul><li>The \"Green Card\" and a Broken Immigration System<br><\/li><li>Permanent Residency through Family Relationship<br><\/li><li>Citizenship through Marriage and the Marriage Fraud Act<br><\/li><li>Immigration through Employment<br><\/li><li>Refugees and Asylum<br><\/li><li>U.S. Immigration Reform<br><\/li><\/ul><h2>Week 5: Breaking the Rules: Deportation Proceedings and Border Security<\/h2><p>Our concluding week focuses upon the various grounds for deportation, deportation proceedings, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration court system. Border security measures seek to protect the nation's security as well as public health and safety. Of particular interest is the \"extended border control\" capability of the Department of Homeland Security. Enhanced border security is one key to political compromise on immigration reform, providing a final opportunity in this course to consider the future direction of immigration law in the United States.<\/p>","courseFormat":"","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Polly J.
