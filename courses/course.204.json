    "shortDescription": "What is the nature of our relationship to others and the world?  How can literature help us see these relationships more clearly? This course seeks to explore such questions through adventurous readings of ten great works of narrative fiction from the 18th to the 20th century.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>As\nindividuals we are defined by relationships, by our connection to people,\nplaces, and things. Such connectedness can be not only emotional or erotic or political or environmental, but even textual, enacted through writing. In\nthis course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten&nbsp;major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to the\npresent. These include: <i>Manon Lescaut<\/i> by Abbé Prévost; two works by Herman Melville, <i>Bartleby the Scrivener <\/i>and <i>Benito Cereno<\/i>; Charlotte Brontë’s <i>Jane Eyre<\/i>; two stories by Franz\nKafka, “The Metamorphosis” and “The Country Doctor”;\nVirginia Woolf’s <i>To the Lighthouse<\/i>; William Faulkner’s <i>Light in August<\/i>;&nbsp; an anthology of stories, <i>Ficciones<\/i>, by Jorge Luis\nBorges; <i>The Ice Palace <\/i>by Tarjei\nVesaas; Tony Morrison’s <i>Beloved;<\/i> and <i>Disgrace<\/i> by J.M. Coetzee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As this course will demonstrate, the most\ncritical relationships in our lives—the linkages both known and unknown—are\nnot always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on\nthese arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the\ncourse will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the\nworld and with others into clearer focus.<\/p>",
