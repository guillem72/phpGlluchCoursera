    "aboutTheCourse": "Have you ever wondered if Superman could really fly? What was \nSpiderman's spidey sense? How did Wonder Woman's invisible jet work? \nWhat does it really mean for something to be a scientific \"fact\"? \nExplore how science works and what constitutes \"good\" science through \ncase studies drawn from a wide spectrum of people's experience, for \nexample superheros, movies, and real world issues such as global \nwarming. The case studies will provide the chance to act as science \ncritics as the students develop a better appreciation for science and \nthe scientific method.<br><br>This course won the 2011 \"Best OCW User Experience\" Award from Education Portal and was featured in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/18\/education\/edlife\/18superhero-t.html\">New York Times<\/a>. <br>",
