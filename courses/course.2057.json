    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Utilizing the RAPID model (Reflective listening, Assessment of needs, Prioritization, Intervention, and Disposition), this specialized course provides perspectives on injuries and trauma that are beyond those physical in nature. The RAPID model is readily applicable to public health settings, the workplace, the military, faith-based organizations, mass disaster venues, and even the demands of more commonplace critical events, e.g., dealing with the psychological aftermath of accidents, robberies, suicide, homicide, or community violence. In addition, the RAPID model has been found effective in promoting personal and community resilience.<\/p>\n<br>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.",
