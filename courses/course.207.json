If archaeologists\nare trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?&nbsp; Who gets to be an archaeologist?&nbsp; How and why do archaeologists hunt for\n“treasures”, and what do we do once we’ve discovered them?&nbsp; What can we know, and not know, about people\nin the past? &nbsp;What do archaeologists know\nabout the past that most people would never guess – and why aren’t we telling\nyou?&nbsp; Why are people entirely willing to\nmurder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? &nbsp;Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the\ntruth behind all this?<\/p>\n\nArchaeology famously involves getting dirty in\nthe line of duty.&nbsp; Students will\nexperience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological\ncase studies.&nbsp; But there are other ‘dirty\nlittle secrets’ to learn about the field: not least how the stories\narchaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both\ngood and bad.&nbsp; Our goal by the end of the\ncourse is to have you ‘thinking like an archaeologist’ and fully aware of the often-fraught\npolitics of doing archaeology around the globe.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p><\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>",
