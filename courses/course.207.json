If archaeologists\nare trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?&nbsp; Who gets to be an archaeologist?&nbsp; How and why do archaeologists hunt for\n\u201ctreasures\u201d, and what do we do once we\u2019ve discovered them?&nbsp; What can we know, and not know, about people\nin the past? &nbsp;What do archaeologists know\nabout the past that most people would never guess \u2013 and why aren\u2019t we telling\nyou?&nbsp; Why are people entirely willing to\nmurder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? &nbsp;Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the\ntruth behind all this?<\/p>\n\nArchaeology famously involves getting dirty in\nthe line of duty.&nbsp; Students will\nexperience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological\ncase studies.&nbsp; But there are other \u2018dirty\nlittle secrets\u2019 to learn about the field: not least how the stories\narchaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both\ngood and bad.&nbsp; Our goal by the end of the\ncourse is to have you \u2018thinking like an archaeologist\u2019 and fully aware of the often-fraught\npolitics of doing archaeology around the globe.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p><\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p><b>Unit #1:<\/b>&nbsp; Just what are\nthese secrets anyway?<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Unit #2:&nbsp; <\/b>What\nhas survived for us to find?&nbsp; And what\nhave we lost?<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Unit #3:<\/b>&nbsp; So how do\nyou find things?&nbsp; Archaeology \u2260\njust digging<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Unit #4:<\/b>&nbsp; How do you\nget a date?
