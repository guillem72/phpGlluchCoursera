{"id":2095,"shortName":"waterwestus","name":"Water in the Western United States","language":"en","shortDescription":"This course combines an overview of the science behind water and climate in the Western United States with a survey of the major legal, political, and cultural issues focused on this precious resource.  ","aboutTheCourse":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Why is water at the heart of so much conflict in the American West? How have major cities and extensive agricultural systems been able to thrive despite most of the region being either a desert or semi-desert environment? How will a warming climate affect the availability and use of water in a region populated by tens of millions of people?&nbsp;<br><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">We begin our journey with an overview of the geography of the Interior West and its extreme contrasts, from snow-capped high mountain peaks to bone-dry deserts. We will then look at how humans have learned to adapt to the peculiarities of life in such a dry place as we examine the history of water development in the region and the main legal, political, and cultural issues at stake.&nbsp;We\u2019ll explore the primary role of snow as a water source as we discuss the physical science of water in the west\u2014where it comes from, how it gets used, and how a warming climate could affect its availability.&nbsp;<\/p>We\u2019ll use the Colorado River, often referred to as the most controlled and most litigated river in the world, as an in-depth case study. A 1922 agreement over sharing the water among seven states set the stage for conflict among states, tribes, the federal government, and others. We\u2019ll see how scientific research into the climatic variability of the River is informing these conflicts and other policy questions, and who is tackling the big issue of what to do if a mega-drought\u2014or a warming climate\u2014were to lead to a reduction in supply in this critical lifeline for much of the American Southwest. Finally, we\u2019ll explore some critical issues in depth and give you the chance to compare management of water supplies in your area\u2014wherever you are located in the world\u2014to that of the arid West.<br><br>For those living in the region, we hope to make this a fascinating look at how water gets to your tap; for those from elsewhere in the world we believe the Interior West makes for a fascinating case study in management of a scarce resource. <br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<b>MODULE 0.
