{"id":210,"shortName":"precalculus","name":"Pre-Calculus","language":"en","shortDescription":"This course covers mathematical topics in algebra and trigonometry and is designed to  prepare students to enroll for a first semester course in single variable calculus.","aboutTheCourse":"Through this course, students will acquire a solid foundation \nin algebra and trigonometry. The course concentrates on the various \nfunctions that are important to the study of the calculus. Emphasis is \nplaced on understanding the properties of linear, polynomial, piecewise, \nexponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Students will \nlearn to work with various types of functions in symbolic, graphical, \nnumerical and verbal form.<br><br><br>THE SIGNATURE TRACK OPTION\n<p>Signature Track is an optional path you may choose for this course. \nBy signing up and paying a nominal fee (financial aid can be provided), \nyou can add a higher level of identity verification to your Coursera \ncoursework. If you achieve the threshold score,\n    you have the opportunity to earn a Verified Certificate. For each assignment, your identity is \nconfirmed through your photo and unique typing pattern. If you earn a \nVerified Certificate, you will also be given a\n    personal URL through which your course records can be shared with \nemployers and educational institutions.<\/p><p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/signature\/guidebook\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> for more information on the Signature Track option.<br><\/p><p>LICENSE<\/p><p>The course videos are licensed Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike-NonCommercial 3.0.

Though not required, this software allows students more&nbsp;pre-calculus problem practice opportunities and a more individualized course experience in which you focus just on those topics you have yet to master. <br><br><strong>A<\/strong>ssessment and <strong>LE<\/strong>arning in <strong>K<\/strong>nowledge <strong>S<\/strong>paces is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning  system. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately  determine exactly what a student knows and does not know in a course.  ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics she is most ready to  learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKS periodically  reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are also retained. <br><br><p>The ALEKS subscription will also enable you limited access to content from\nthe textbook \"Precalculus\" by Barnett, Ziegler, Byleen and Sobecki. This access is in the form of PDF files linked from the \"Explanation\" pages of\nparticular topics in ALEKS. Some students may prefer a physical version of this\ntextbook. You can purchase that from any online textbook retailer.
