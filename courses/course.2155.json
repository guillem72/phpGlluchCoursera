This course begins from your starting point and explores how we might make positive differences to the future of our planet, and encourage others to do so.\n","aboutTheCourse":"<p>Many issues threaten\nthe future of ourselves and other species on the planet.&nbsp;The most\nprominent of these is dangerous global climate change; and this with the\nover-exploitation of our lands and seas, loss of biodiversity,\nand&nbsp;over-use of manufactured chemicals, affects the stability of the\nglobal systems upon which all life depends. For our species these (and other\nfactors) contribute to social inequalities and impact on human well-being and\neconomic stability. It is imperative that we develop an informed response to\nthese challenges and that we feel empowered and enabled to take positive\nactions towards a sustainable future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In this course you\nwill refine your own understanding of 'sustainability' in light of the range of\ndefinitions, contexts and educational approaches that we will discuss. This\nprocess will enable you to develop a personal ethic and positive response to\n\u2018sustainability\u2019, and help you to communicate these ideas to others.
