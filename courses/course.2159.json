    "recommendedBackground": "The course is positioned at an intermediate level: no prior knowledge of organisation theory is assumed, but the course will quickly move through the basic ideas and on to the more advanced concepts.&nbsp; It is suitable for people with a good working knowledge of large organisations (private or public sector), or for students who have already taken courses in the basics of business and management.&nbsp; It would also be appropriate for practising managers who do not have a strong theoretical background.",
