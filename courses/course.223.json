Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of \nduality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows.\u00a0<br><br>The\n course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization \nthat is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at \nEPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, \nand a final exam. <br>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<ul><li>Linear programming, modeling, equivalence of standard forms <\/li><li>Basic solutions, primal and dual feasible basic solutions, pivoting and the simplex method<\/li><li>Termination and complexity of the simplex method <\/li><li>Integer programming, bipartite matching and flows<\/li><li>Models of computation, bit-complexity<\/li><\/ul><br>","courseFormat":"The\n class consists of lecture videos punctuated by quizzes.
