    "shortDescription": "Learn how to transform information from a format efficient for computation into a format efficient for human perception, cognition, and communication. Explore elements of computer graphics, human-computer interaction, perceptual psychology, and design in addition to data processing and computation.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Learn to <strong>present data<\/strong> to an observer in a way that yields insight and understanding. The first week focuses on the <strong>infrastructure for data visualization<\/strong>. It introduces elementary graphics programming, focusing primarily on two-dimensional vector graphics and the programming platforms for graphics. This infrastructure will also include lessons on the <strong>human side of visualization<\/strong>, studying human perception and cognition to gain a better understanding of the target of the data visualization.<\/p>\n \n<p>The second week will utilize the knowledge of graphics programming and human perception in the <strong>design and construction of visualizations<\/strong>, starting with simple charts and graphs and incorporating animation and user interactivity. The third week expands the data visualization vocabulary with more sophisticated methods, including <strong>hierarchical layouts and networks<\/strong>. The final week focuses on visualization of database and data mining processes, with methods specifically focused on <strong>visualization of unstructured information<\/strong>, such as text, and systems for visual analytics that provide decision support.<\/p>",
