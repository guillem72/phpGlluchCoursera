    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Learn about \"<strong>cloudonomics<\/strong>,\" the underlying economic reasons that we are creating the cloud. Learn the <strong>basic concepts underlying cloud services<\/strong> and be able to use services like AWS or OpenStack Dashboard to construct cloud services or applications. <strong>Demonstrate your ability<\/strong> to create web services, massively parallel data intensive computations using Map\/Reduce, NoSQL databases, and real-time processing of real-time data streams. Use machine learning tools to solve simple problems.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course serves as an introduction to building applications for cloud computing based on <strong>emerging OpenStack<\/strong> and other platforms. The course includes concepts of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baremetal provisioning<\/li>\n<li>Neutron networking<\/li>\n<li>Identity service<\/li>\n<li>Image service<\/li>\n<li>Orchestration<\/li>\n<li>Infrastructure as a service<\/li>\n<li>Software as a service<\/li>\n<li>Platform as a service<\/li>\n<li>MapReduce<\/li>\n<li>Big data<\/li>\n<li>Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Privacy and legal issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The course will also include example problems and solutions to cloud computing, including <strong>hands-on laboratory experiments<\/strong> (Load Balancing and Web Services, MapReduce, Hive, Storm, and Mahout). <strong>Case studies<\/strong> will be drawn from Yahoo, Google, Twitter, Facebook, data mining, analytics, and machine learning.<br><\/p>",
