Learn the <strong>basic concepts underlying cloud services<\/strong> and be able to use services like AWS or OpenStack Dashboard to construct cloud services or applications. <strong>Demonstrate your ability<\/strong> to create web services, massively parallel data intensive computations using Map\/Reduce, NoSQL databases, and real-time processing of real-time data streams. Use machine learning tools to solve simple problems.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course serves as an introduction to building applications for cloud computing based on <strong>emerging OpenStack<\/strong> and other platforms.
