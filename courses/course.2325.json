In just the last few years, we have witnessed calls from all over the world, from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arab_spring\">Arab Spring<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Occupy_Wall_Street\">Occupy Wall Street<\/a> to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.opengovpartnership.org\/\">Open Government Partnership<\/a>, for governments to become more open, accountable and responsive by deepening their engagement with citizens. As a result, interest in citizen engagement programs for effective development has gained momentum.<span> At the same time the World\nBank Group, which has long recognized the role of citizen engagement in\nimproving development results, has developed a strategic approach to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/consultations.worldbank.org\/Data\/hub\/files\/consultation-template\/engaging-citizens-improved-resultsopenconsultationtemplate\/materials\/finalstrategicframeworkforce_4.pdf\">mainstreaming\ncitizen engagement<\/a> in its operations. <\/span>This MOOC has been developed to explore what is meant by citizen engagement and how it can be used to enhance development impact.<\/p><p>This second offering of the course includes a new, exciting fifth module that looks at citizen engagement in practice. We hear from local practitioners implementing different citizen engagement approaches in various sectors including water, health, and education in Ghana and Kenya. They discuss how citizen engagement mechanisms and tools are adapted for their specific country context and sector, examining practical challenges and lessons learned. We also look at Korea’s innovative approach to involving citizens in the audit of public services. <\/p>\n<p>The 5-week course brings together a diverse range of experts to provide students with a comprehensive overview of citizen engagement. It begins by synthesizing the theories and concepts that underlie citizen engagement, and goes on to explore how citizens can be engaged in both policymaking and public service delivery. Finally, the course investigates how recent innovations are shaking up the field, and how citizen engagement is implemented, monitored and evaluated in the field. Our presenters, leaders in academia, government, and civil society, provide a wide range of perspectives and real-world experience to give participants a deeper understanding of whether citizen engagement can truly enhance the process of development. Participants will also have the opportunity to collaborate with one another and design their own citizen engagement initiatives, thereby putting theories learned in the course into practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Course Instructors and Facilitators <\/h2>\n<p>The course instructors are <strong>Jeff Thindwa, Björn-Sören Gigler, <\/strong><strong> Tiago Peixoto and Helene Grandvoinnet<\/strong>.

We begin by exploring the definitions and history of citizen engagement, as well as related concepts such as transparency, accountability, responsiveness and inclusiveness. We then look at the concept of the feedback loop, and the differences between intrinsic and instrumental approaches. Next we examine the crucial role of sociopolitical context and the enabling environment, and finally introduce the concept of strategic and tactical approaches to citizen engagement.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Week 2: Engaging Citizens for Improved Policymaking<\/strong><br>\nThis week explores the role that citizens can play in actively shaping public policy. We start by examining how citizens participate, analyzing the differences between ‘thick’ and ‘thin’ forms of engagement and asking strategic questions such as who should participate, how should participants interact with decision makers, what information do participants need, and how will participation impact policy decisions. Next, we survey examples of crowdsourcing and open innovation that are helping governments and citizens better interact. Finally, we unpack why citizens participate, moving beyond the mere calculation of costs and benefits described in the rational choice model to an analysis of broader factors that influence participation.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Week 3: Can Engaging Citizens Bring Better Services?<\/strong><br>\nIn this week we examine the role of citizen engagement in public service delivery. We first unpack different conceptions of the government-citizen relationship and then explore the ways citizens can serve as active agents of, rather than passive recipients in, the delivery of public services. We then provide an in-depth look at a range of citizen engagement projects in this area by exploring the methods, tools, barriers to inclusion and factors for success of case studies, particularly in developing country contexts.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Week 4: Innovations in Citizen Engagement<\/strong><br>\nHaving outlined the role of citizen engagement during policymaking and service delivery, the final week investigates recent innovations in citizen engagement. We begin by examining how recent advances in information and communications technology (ICT) can be used to enhance citizen engagement from a human development perspective, and review some of the most compelling new developments in this area. Next, we explore the reasons why some of these innovative approaches succeed while others fail, and look at how hybrid approaches-those that combine ICT tools with traditional methodologies-are being used in an attempt to maximize development results. <br><br>\n<strong>Week 5: Citizen Engagement in Practice<\/strong><br>\n\nThe last module of this course analyzes citizen engagement in practice. We hear from local practitioners implementing different citizen engagement approaches in various sectors including water, health, and education in Ghana and Kenya. They discuss how citizen engagement mechanisms and tools are adapted for their specific country context and sector, examining practical challenges and lessons learned. We also look at Korea’s innovative approach to involving citizens in the audit of public services.<br>\n\n<br>\nWe conclude the course with a review video, as well as ‘call to action’ videos from high-profile leaders in government, civil society and academia and to provide you with tangible next steps to put your knowledge into practice.  <br>\n<h2>Course Tracks<\/h2>\n<img alt=\"\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 10px; width:275px;\" src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/engagecitizen\/images\/course-tracks.jpg\">\nDepending on your level of interest, you can choose to participate in one of two tracks:<br><br>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Track 1: Citizen Engagement Champions (1-2 hours\/week)<\/li>\n<li>Track 2: Policy and Leadership (2-4 hours\/week)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nStudents can move from the Citizen Engagement Champions track to the Policy and Leadership track at any point during the course.
