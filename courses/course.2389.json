Winters are cold and snowy; spring brings thunderstorms, heavy rains and tornadoes; summers are hot and humid and the transition to autumn paves the way for especially windy storms like the one that sunk the Edmund Fitzgerald (a massive iron ore freighter that sank in Lake Superior in 1975). <br><br>On top of all this, climate change is adding to the complexity. Numerous observations demonstrate that the climate of the Great Lakes Region is changing. Average temperatures are getting warmer and extreme heat events are occurring more frequently. Total precipitation is increasing and heavy precipitation events are becoming more common. Winters are getting shorter and duration of lake ice cover is decreasing.&nbsp; We\u2019ll share the data with you before focusing on people and communities adjusting to these changes. And to slow the rate of future climate change, we\u2019ll share actions you can take that benefit you and everyone who loves the weather and climate of the Great Lakes Region. <br><br><br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"Each week of the course examines the weather of each season, observed climate change and expert interviews exploring relevant issues and changes that are underway. <br><br><ul><li><strong>Week 1: Winter:<\/strong> (Dec-Jan-Feb) You will learn about classic storm tracks, lake effect snow, extreme winter events and weather safety as well as changes in snow cover, temperature and lake ice. &nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Week 2: Spring:<\/strong> (Mar-Apr-May) This week will focus on the water cycle in the Great Lakes Region and how heavy precipitation events affect urban areas. <\/li><li><strong>Week 3: Summer:<\/strong> (Jun-Jul-Aug) Week three will feature content on air quality, heat waves and severe summer storms. <\/li><li><strong>Week 4: Fall\/Autumn:<\/strong> (Sept-Oct-Nov) The final week of the course examines the sometimes turbulent weather of the Great Lakes region in autumn. We will also learn about agriculture in the region and some ways individuals can mitigate and adapt to changing climate conditions.<\/li><\/ul><br><br>","courseFormat":"This course consists of short videos between 2 and 12 minutes long that include a guest speaker each week, an overview of the weather for each season, observed changes and an interview with a regional expert. There will also be a quiz each week and several interactive activities, as well as supplemental readings. Those wishing to obtain a Statement of Accomplishment will need to take the weekly quizzes and participate in the weekly discussion forums. Otherwise, feel free to focus on the areas that most interest you.<br>","suggestedReadings":"Supplemental readings will be provided weekly; no books are required for purchase. <br><br>","estimatedClassWorkload":"1-3 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"","links":{}}
