Finally, multiple-regression models will then be debuted,\nand will be used to assess confounding and effect modification, produce\nadjusted and stratum-specific estimates, and to allow for better prediction of\nan outcome via the use of multiple predictors.&nbsp;\nLinear spline models and propensity score methods for adjustment will\nalso be briefly introduced.&nbsp; All of the\ntopics covered in this course will be reinforced with multiple examples from current\nand classical public health and medical studies.<\/p><p><br><\/p>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Simple regression models: linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression<\/li>\n    <li>Confounding<\/li>\n    <li>Effect Modification<\/li>\n    <li>Multiple regression models (linear, logistic, Cox) for:<\/li>\n<ul>    \n<li>Prediction with multiple factors<\/li>\n    <li>Estimating adjusted associations<\/li>\n    <li>Assessing and testing for effect modification<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n    <li>Techniques for handling violations of regression linearity assumptions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>","courseFormat":"The course consists of&nbsp;10 lecture sets,&nbsp;3 (optional) homework problem sets, and&nbsp;4 graded quizzes.","suggestedReadings":"","estimatedClassWorkload":"3-5 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/statreasoning\" target=\"_blank\">Statistical Reasoning 1: Estimation, Inference, and Interpretation<\/a>","links":{}}
