We also need\nto ask some critical questions. What role does democracy\nplay in the development of the common law? To what extent are human rights\ncentral to the modern common law? How does the common law of England and Wales\nrelate to the law of the European Union? Answering these questions will give us\ninsights into the current challenges the law faces\nand its possible futures.<\/p>",
