    "aboutTheCourse": "<p><span>Intended for both newcomers who are\ncurious about video games and experienced gamers who want to reflect on their\npassion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films\nwhen they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.&nbsp; <i>The\nLord of the Rings <\/i>trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central\nexample of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across\nmedia.&nbsp; <\/span><\/p><p><span>The course is\ndesigned as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre,\nmultimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human\nactivity of storytelling.&nbsp; Our journey\nwill enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some\nkey topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video\ngames.&nbsp; It will also take us to some\nlandmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most\nfantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The\nFellowship of the Ring<\/i>, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s <i>Faerie Queene<\/i>, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Drawing on centuries\nof romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has\nbecome a creative and economic powerhouse.&nbsp;\nIt engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists,\ncomposers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing\nprofessionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.&nbsp; Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to\nbe conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of\nstories.&nbsp; Join me as we set out on an\nintellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online\ngames.<\/p><p>Reviews of the last offering:<br><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/penny-arcade.com\/report\/article\/why-40000-students-from-around-the-world-have-signed-up-to-study-lord-of-th\">http:\/\/penny-arcade.com\/report\/article\/why-40000-students-from-around-the-world-have-signed-up-to-st...<\/a><br><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/inventorspot.com\/articles\/gaming_lotr_and_new_media_interview_professor_jay_clayton\">http:\/\/inventorspot.com\/articles\/gaming_lotr_and_new_media_interview_professor_jay_clayton<\/a><br><\/li><\/ul><\/p>",

    "recommendedBackground": "<p>No\nbackground in gaming is required. \nWhether you are non-gamer who is interested in understanding what video games are all about, a person who loves both popular culture and\nserious literature, or a guild leader who runs large raids three nights a week,\nthis course will challenge you to think more deeply about important issues\nconfronting our culture.<\/p>\n\nYou do not have to play The Lord of the Rings\nOnline™ (LOTRO) to enroll in this class because we will have two tracks, one for those who are able to play LOTRO and the other for people who would like to learn about video games, Tolkien, and the romance tradition but choose not to play themselves.  <br><br>LOTRO is free to play.  There is no cost to download or play in the\nShire, Bree, Lone Lands, and the other regions we will be studying.  Most people who continue playing for longer\nthan a few months choose to pay for what Turbine calls VIP status, but the\nfree-to-play content will provide you with months of game time.  Those students who want to play LOTRO will need access to a computer\ncapable of running the game. The computer requirements for LOTRO are detailed on\nthe Turbine web site: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lotro.com\/free.php\">http:\/\/www.lotro.com\/free.php<\/a>.",
