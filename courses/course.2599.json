    "shortDescription": "This course introduces you to the design and implementation of Android applications for mobile devices. You will develop an app from scratch, assuming a basic knowledge of Java, and learn how to set up Android Studio, work with various Activities and create simple user interfaces to make your apps run smoothly. ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Google’s Android OS runs 81% of smartphones worldwide and has shipped over one billion units this past year alone. Meanwhile, the search for talented Android developers continues, making it one of the most in-demand software development skills today.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to learn Android app development, and have a background in Java, this course will get you started with:<\/p><ul><li>Android Studio and the Android Development Environment<br><\/li><li>Screen configurations and sizes<br><\/li><li>Activity Class, Intents and Permission, Fragments<br><\/li><li>Designing user interfaces<br><\/li><\/ul><p>You’ll apply what you’ve learned through hands-on labs and exercises, including developing an app inspired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. From there, you’ll continue on to Part 2 learn about features that support more advanced Android applications, such as Threads, AsyncTasks, Handlers, User Notifications and BroadcastReceivers.<\/p>\n\n<b>A Comprehensive Program for Android Developers<\/b><br>This course is a part of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/specialization\/mobilecloudcomputing2\/36?utm_medium=listingPage\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android Specialization<\/a><\/strong>, a comprehensive program in which you will learn to create&nbsp;create&nbsp;complex, cloud-based Android applications, applying what you've learned through hands-on activities and a final project designed with industry partners.<br><br><i>\"This is an excellent resource for any developer wishing to enter the growing mobile app industry.

    "recommendedBackground": "<div><span><p dir=\"ltr\">This course is created for students who already know how to program in Java, but are not expected to have studied mobile application development. This corresponds roughly to Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate students in a computer science related discipline or the equivalent.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you don't already know Java, but have strong familiarity with other programming languages, you can improve your Java knowledge by taking one of the many Java tutorials and online courses available on the web.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As discussed above, this course assumes previous programming knowledge. It also assumes that you are willing to search for, read and learn from Android's developer documentation. This is both a necessary skill for success in the class, and, in our experience, a necessary skill for successful Android developers at all levels.<\/strong><\/p>In short, this course is not designed for truly novice programmers. If your background is not appropriate for this class, consider first taking a less programming-intensive introduction to Android such as \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/androidapps101\">Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps<\/a>\", by Lawrence Angrave of the University of Illinois and Urbana-Champaign.<\/span><br><\/div>",
