This corresponds roughly to Sophomore- or Junior-level undergraduate students in a computer science related discipline or the equivalent.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you don't already know Java, but have strong familiarity with other programming languages, you can improve your Java knowledge by taking one of the many Java tutorials and online courses available on the web.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As discussed above, this course assumes previous programming knowledge. It also assumes that you are willing to search for, read and learn from Android's developer documentation. This is both a necessary skill for success in the class, and, in our experience, a necessary skill for successful Android developers at all levels.<\/strong><\/p>In short, this course is not designed for truly novice programmers. If your background is not appropriate for this class, consider first taking a less programming-intensive introduction to Android such as \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/androidapps101\">Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps<\/a>\", by Lawrence Angrave of the University of Illinois and Urbana-Champaign.<\/span><br><\/div>","links":{}}
