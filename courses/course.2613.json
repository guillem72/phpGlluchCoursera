    "shortDescription": "Regression modeling is the standard method for analysis of continuous\nresponse data. This course provides theoretical and practical training in statistical\nmodeling with particular emphasis on linear and multiple regression.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Statistical modeling is a fundamental element of analysis for statisticians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians and other professionals of related disciplines. People in the health sciences profession rely on regression modeling to gain insight on make decisions based on a continuous flow of response data.<br><br>Focusing on linear and multiple regression, this course will provide theoretical and practical training&nbsp;in statistical modeling.<br><br>This is a hands-on, applied course where students will become proficient at using computer software to analyze data drawn primarily from the fields of medicine, epidemiology and public health.<br><br>There will be many practical examples and homework exercises in this class to help you learn.&nbsp;If you fully apply yourself in this course and complete all of the homework, you will have the opportunity to master methods of statistical modeling when the response variable is continuous and you will become a confident user of the Stata* package for computing linear, polynomial and multiple\nregression.<br><br>*Access to Stata will be provided at no cost for the duration of this course.<br><br>\n<hr>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/appliedregression\/CVV-logo-1.png\" style=\"float:middle\" alt=\"Centre Virchow-Villermé logo\"><br><br>This course was developed in partnership with the <a href=\"http:\/\/virchowvillerme.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre Virchow-Villermé for Public Health Paris-Berlin<\/a>, a bi-national centre of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sorbonne-paris-cite.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\">Université Sorbonne Paris Cité<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.charite.de\/en\/charite\/\" target=\"_blank\">Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin<\/a>.

    "recommendedBackground": "<p>Students interested in this course should have taken a solid introductory statistical methods course. While not absolutely necessary, familiarity with some statistical software package (such as SPSS, SAS or R) would definitely be an advantage.&nbsp;<\/p><p>We will be making exclusive use of Stata for the course lectures and homework solutions. However, students who are proficient in other packages could use those packages in place of Stata.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Based on past experience we strongly encourage students to use Stata for this course as it will facilitate communications with the professor, the teaching assistants, as well as other students in the course.<\/p>",
