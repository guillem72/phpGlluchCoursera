    "aboutTheCourse": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques. A <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_design_pattern\">pattern<\/a> describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. A <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_framework\">framework<\/a> is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of patterns that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC will cover Android's Handlers, Messages, and Runnables (HaMeR) framework and its AsyncTask framework, which simplify the development of Android applications that can run long-duration operations in background threads and then publish the results of these operations to the User Interface thread, which then performs short-duration user-facing operations. &nbsp;Some coverage of Java threads will be included to provide background on concurrent programming. Hands-on programming projects will require students to apply these two concurrency frameworks to representative Android applications.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the third course of the six-course <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/specialization\/mobilecloudcomputing\/2\">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization<\/a>. It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final “capstone” project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, \"Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015.

They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp;<\/p><\/li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">The third, fourth. and fifth MOOCs by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/posaconcurrency\" title=\"Link: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/posaconcurrency\">Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/posacommunication\">Communication<\/a>, and Content.&nbsp;They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;<\/p><\/li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">The sixth and seventh MOOCs by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/mobilecloudprogram\">Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/mobilecloudsecurity\">Security<\/a>. &nbsp;They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. <\/p><\/li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the programming assignments for these MOOCs will be coordinated. &nbsp;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.<br><\/p>",

    "recommendedBackground": "Ideally, students who take this MOOC will have already taken Professor Porter’s MOOCs on “Programming Mobile Applications with Android Handheld Systems”. Students should also be familiar with general object-oriented design and programming concepts (such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)), fundamental object-oriented programming language features (such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and generics available in Java, basic systems programming concepts (such as event handling, processes\/threads, synchronization, inter-process communication, and dynamic linking), and networking terminology (such as client\/server and peer-to-peer architectures, TCP\/IP, and layering). &nbsp;Overviews of object-oriented design, systems programming, and networking concepts and techniques are available in the supplemental videos, but it's essential that students &nbsp;understand how to read\/write Java code examples.<br>",
