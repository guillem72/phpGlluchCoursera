{"id":2623,"shortName":"posaconcurrency","name":"Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency","language":"en","shortDescription":"In this MOOC, we will learn how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent applications on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms. ","aboutTheCourse":"<p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques. A <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_design_pattern\">pattern<\/a> describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. A <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_framework\">framework<\/a> is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of patterns that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC will cover Android's Handlers, Messages, and Runnables (HaMeR) framework and its AsyncTask framework, which simplify the development of Android applications that can run long-duration operations in background threads and then publish the results of these operations to the User Interface thread, which then performs short-duration user-facing operations. &nbsp;Some coverage of Java threads will be included to provide background on concurrent programming. Hands-on programming projects will require students to apply these two concurrency frameworks to representative Android applications.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the third course of the six-course <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/specialization\/mobilecloudcomputing\/2\">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization<\/a>. It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final \u201ccapstone\u201d project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn\u2019t quite finish before.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, \"Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems\u201d offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015.
