    "shortDescription": "Fluid-Solid Interactions happen when the motion  of solids and fluids are coupled. The aim of the course is to give you  the basic tools to  be able to understand, predict and eventually mitigate these interactions.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>What is &nbsp;fluid-solid interactions&nbsp; ?&nbsp; It\nis what happens when the &nbsp;motions of a\nfluid and of a solid are somehow coupled. This\nhappens&nbsp; all the time,&nbsp; around\nyou when leaves flutter in the wind,&nbsp; inside you when your heart beats, above you\nwhen wings of a plane vibrate, under the sea... \n\n<\/p>The\nidea behind this MOOC&nbsp; is to give you the\nbasic tools to &nbsp;be able to predict and\neventually mitigate &nbsp;&nbsp;things called &nbsp;flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced\nvibrations, added mass,&nbsp; to cite a few.&nbsp; <br><p>We are\ngoing to consider &nbsp;any &nbsp;possible domains of applications&nbsp; such as civil engineering,&nbsp; aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering ,\nocean engineering, biomechanics and even food&nbsp;\nprocessing ! <br><\/p>\n\n<p>This is why\nwe &nbsp;called the course “Fundamentals of\nFluid Solid Interactions ”. There are so many phenomena and so many models &nbsp;that&nbsp; we\n&nbsp;&nbsp;need to work together on the basic\nmechanisms . <\/p><p>If &nbsp;you want to see how fluid-solid interactions\nwork,&nbsp; and be able to use that knowledge,\njoin us !<\/p>",
