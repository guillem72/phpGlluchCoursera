The aim of the course is to give you  the basic tools to  be able to understand, predict and eventually mitigate these interactions.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>What is &nbsp;fluid-solid interactions&nbsp; ?&nbsp; It\nis what happens when the &nbsp;motions of a\nfluid and of a solid are somehow coupled. This\nhappens&nbsp; all the time,&nbsp; around\nyou when leaves flutter in the wind,&nbsp; inside you when your heart beats, above you\nwhen wings of a plane vibrate, under the sea... \n\n<\/p>The\nidea behind this MOOC&nbsp; is to give you the\nbasic tools to &nbsp;be able to predict and\neventually mitigate &nbsp;&nbsp;things called &nbsp;flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced\nvibrations, added mass,&nbsp; to cite a few.&nbsp; <br><p>We are\ngoing to consider &nbsp;any &nbsp;possible domains of applications&nbsp; such as civil engineering,&nbsp; aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering ,\nocean engineering, biomechanics and even food&nbsp;\nprocessing ! <br><\/p>\n\n<p>This is why\nwe &nbsp;called the course \u201cFundamentals of\nFluid Solid Interactions \u201d. There are so many phenomena and so many models &nbsp;that&nbsp; we\n&nbsp;&nbsp;need to work together on the basic\nmechanisms . <\/p><p>If &nbsp;you want to see how fluid-solid interactions\nwork,&nbsp; and be able to use that knowledge,\njoin us !<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p><strong>Week\n1&nbsp;:&nbsp; Dimensional analysis of fluid-solid coupling<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>The variety of fluid-solid couplings<\/li><li>Dimensional analysis as a classification tool<\/li><li>Dimensionless numbers in fluid-solid interactions <br><\/li><li>From dimensionless numbers to dimensionless equations<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Week 2&nbsp;: A solid with a still\nfluid. <\/strong><br><\/p><ul><li>Low reduced velocities<\/li><li>Small motions and low reduced velocities<br><\/li><li>Fluid-added Stiffness<\/li><li>Neglecting viscous effects <br><\/li><li>Fluid-added mass. <br><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Week 3&nbsp;: A solid with any fluid. <\/strong><br><\/p><ul><li>Dominant effects of viscosity<\/li><li>Fluid-added damping&nbsp;<\/li><li>Combined effects of fluid viscosity<\/li><li>Memory&nbsp; effects&nbsp;<\/li><li>Fluid sloshing <br><\/li><li>Coupling of&nbsp; fluid sloshing with solid dynamics <br><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Week 4 &nbsp;: Coupling with a fast flow.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>High reduced velocities<\/li><li>Flow-induced static instabilities, or buckling<\/li><li>Coupled-mode flutter of airfoils. <br><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Week 5&nbsp;: Coupling with a slow flow. <\/strong><br><\/p><ul><li>Intermediate reduced velocities<\/li><li>Flutter on one mode <br><\/li><li>Stall flutter of airfoils <br><\/li><li>Galloping of bluff bodies <br><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Week 6&nbsp;: Coupling with any&nbsp; flow. <\/strong><br><\/p><ul><li>The fluid conveying pipe as a reference model of coupling <br><\/li><li>Coriolis damping<\/li><li>Solution for any flow velocity<br><\/li><li>From one mode to two modes<br><\/li><li>Vortex-induced vibrations<\/li><li>Lock-in as a case of coupled-mode flutter<\/li><\/ul>","courseFormat":"The class will consist every week of 10 min&nbsp; lecture videos (about 4 or 5 per week), with&nbsp; videos of related experiments and of&nbsp; related on-going research programs&nbsp; <br>There will be assessments in the form of&nbsp; multiple choice questions, and also&nbsp; of peer-reviewed projects. <br>","suggestedReadings":"The lecture are self-contained, but the students will find useful additional information in the following book in paperback : Pa\u00efdoussis, M.
