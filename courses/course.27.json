The lectures are each broken into about 4-6 segments, separated by interactive quiz questions for you to to help you process and understand the material. In addition, there will be a problem set and a programming assignment each week and there will be a final exam.","suggestedReadings":"Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in this 7-week class can find much more extensive coverage of these topics in our book <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/13VNJi7\">Algorithms (4th Edition)<\/a><img width=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=coursera-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=032157351X\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; display: none !important; visibility: hidden !important; opacity: 0 !important; background-position: 0px 0px;\">, published by Addison-Wesley Professional.","instructor":"Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick","estimatedClassWorkload":"6-12 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"You need basic familiarity with programming in Java and the algorithms and data structures from Algorithms, Part I.\u00a0This course is primarily aimed at first- and second-year undergraduates interested in engineering or science, along with high school students and professionals with an interest (and some background) in programming.","links":{}}
