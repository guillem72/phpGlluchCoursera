{"id":2755,"shortName":"interactivepython1","name":"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)","language":"en","shortDescription":"This two-part course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Our main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids. ","aboutTheCourse":"This two-part course (part 2 is available <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/interactivepython2\">here<\/a>)  is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications. Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.<p><\/p><p>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python. To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. When you\u2019ve finished our course, we can\u2019t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you\u2019re doing it.<\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"Our course syllabus can be seen at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeskulptor.org\/coursera\/interactivepython.html\">www.codeskulptor.org\/coursera\/interactivepython.html<\/a>.","courseFormat":"The first part of the course will last five weeks. &nbsp;The lectures from each week will focus on the topics listed in the syllabus&nbsp;while an associated weekly \u201cmini- project\u201d will serve to reinforce these concepts in practice. &nbsp;Grades for&nbsp;these mini-projects will be determined via&nbsp;peer-assessment. &nbsp;The class will also include two quizzes each week to provide further feedback.","suggestedReadings":"","estimatedClassWorkload":"7-10 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"A knowledge of high school mathematics is required. While the class is designed for students with no prior programming experience, some beginning programmers have viewed the class as being fast-paced. For students interested in some light preparation prior to the start of class, we recommend a self-paced Python learning site such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/tracks\/python\">codecademy.com<\/a>","links":{}}
