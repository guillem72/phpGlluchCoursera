To be practical, we\u2019ll focus on data every university records; to keep things interesting, we\u2019ll examine questions raised by many audiences; to ensure impact, we\u2019ll provide realistic data and example code. ","aboutTheCourse":"<p>Everyone involved in higher\neducation has questions. Students want to know how they\u2019re doing and which\nclasses they should take. Faculty members want to understand their students\u2019\nbackgrounds and to learn whether their teaching techniques are effective. Staff\nmembers want to be sure the advice they provide is appropriate and find out whether\ncollege requirements accomplish their goals. Administrators want to explore how\nall of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes.\nThe public wants to know what happens in college and why.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everyone has questions. We have\nthe chance to help them find answers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Learning analytics is about using\ndata to improve teaching and learning. You might wonder why there\u2019s suddenly so\nmuch conversation about this previously invisible topic.<a>[1]<\/a> After\nall, institutions of higher education have maintained careful records of\nstudent progress and outcomes for more than a century. &nbsp;They have always been ready to provide a\ntranscript for every student, reporting all courses taken, grades received,\nhonors awarded, and degrees conferred. Institutional research offices provide\nsummaries of these student records to campus leaders, accreditation agencies,\nand the public. Why learning analytics now?<\/p>\n\n<p>Two major trends drive the\ncurrent emergence of learning analytics. First, data informing teaching and\nlearning are increasingly extensive and accessible. Second, innovative new analytic\napproaches to digesting, visualizing, and acting on these data emerge every day.<\/p><p><u>What\u2019s special about this\ncourse?<\/u><\/p><p><i>Practical Learning Analytics<\/i> has a specific goal: to help us\ncollectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way. To keep it practical,\nwe will focus on using traditional student record data, the kinds of data every\ncampus already has. To make it interesting, we will address questions raised by\nan array of different stakeholders, including campus leaders, faculty, staff,\nand especially students. To provide analytic teeth, each analysis we discuss\nwill be supported by both realistic data and sample code.<\/p><p><u>Who should take this course?<\/u><\/p><p><i>Practical Learning Analytics<\/i> should provide something for anyone\ninterested in higher education: current, former, or future students, policy\nmakers, academic advisors, data scientists, university administrators, ed-tech\nentrepreneurs, faculty members, even the curious public. <\/p><p>This course has been designed to\nwork for a wide variety of audiences. Its structure is modeled on something\neveryone can enjoy: a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord\">sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord<\/a> \u2013\nwe\u2019re going to treat the class like one big meal. After we set the table, each\nguest may wander the room, taking either a small plate or a full entr\u00e9e from a\nseries of courses we offer up. When everyone is full, we\u2019ll gather again over\ncoffee to hear what people thought. There is no defined way to pursue such a\nmeal \u2013 each diner chooses what\u2019s right for them. And there is no defined way to\ntake this course \u2013 every student must choose what\u2019s right for them.<\/p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>The course will open with a two\nweek introduction, exploring the landscape of learning analytics in higher\neducation and setting the table for the main event. This is followed by a four\nweek meal during which participants may choose among an array of five different\ntopics, each presented at two levels: a small plate providing a quick\nintroduction, or a more filling entr\u00e9e. Those choosing small plates will still have\nthe opportunity to work with realistic data, analyzing it with code we provide.\nThose choosing entr\u00e9es will make creative contributions of their own: writing\nnew code for analysis or visualization of the data we provide, perhaps bringing\nin data of their own. After this month of exploration, the final two weeks will\nfeature a concluding coffee. In them, we\u2019ll review what students learned while\nwandering through all five courses, share the best things class members\ninvented, and provide some concluding remarks.<\/p><div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n<p><a>[1]<\/a>\nTry searching for \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/ngrams\/graph?content=learning+analytics&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=\">learning\nanalytics<\/a>\u201d in the Google Ngram server\u2026nothing comes up!<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"<p><u>The menu:<\/u><\/p>\n\n<p>Our sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord will include five\nmajor courses, each offered in both small plate and full entr\u00e9e sizes.

Small plate users\nwill watch a few video lectures about their topic, complete a short quiz on the\ncontent, download the data and R code, and run an analysis to answer some simple\nquestions. Users who choose the entr\u00e9e will go further, extending the code in\nboth instructor-specified and student defined ways.
