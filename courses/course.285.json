","aboutTheCourse":"This introductory virology course emphasizes the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.<br><br>This offering has been a top-ten iTunes U Cours<b><\/b>e in sciences pretty much since its release in 2012, with over 80,000 subscriptions.
