Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.<\/p><p>This course will explore the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. We will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs.
