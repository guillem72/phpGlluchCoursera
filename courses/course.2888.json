{"id":2888,"shortName":"nudgeit","name":"Nudge-it: Understanding obesity","language":"en","shortDescription":"Nudge-it is an multi-disciplinary European research project studying new ways of establishing and reinforcing healthy eating habits. Join us to learn about eating, appetite and obesity.","aboutTheCourse":"<span>Obesity is a huge health, social and economic problem affecting millions\n of people globally. Currently, it\u2019s a problem without a solution - \ndieting is difficult, drug therapies are poor, and surgical solutions are \nonly offered to those suffering serious ill-health. In addition, there \nare many common misconceptions about appetite, diet and exercise, and about the\n best ways to treat or prevent obesity.<br>\n<br>\nThis course will be taught by partners in the EU-funded research project Nudge-it.\n This project brings together dozens of experts in neurobiology, psychology and&nbsp;behavioural economics from universities in the UK, Germany, \nthe Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, the US and New Zealand. \nThe project's overall aim is to better understand decision-making in food choice \nand to contribute to improving public health policy.<br>\n<br>\nIn this course we will discuss the facts and misconceptions around \nobesity, and the gaps in the scientific knowledge. We\u2019ll discuss key \nphysiological and psychological concepts around the brain\u2019s control of \nappetite and body weight, and reflect on the power of these systems - \nhow they make weight gain easy and weight loss hard. We will describe \nnew approaches to the treatment and prevention of obesity, and give you \nthe opportunity to reflect on your own knowledge and assumptions around \nthe causes of obesity.<br><br><\/span><span>If you\u2019re on Twitter, tell us why you are taking\nthe course \u2013 use the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23nudgeitmooc&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>#nudgeitmooc<\/strong><\/a><\/span><span><br><br><\/span>Visit the project website at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nudge-it.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.nudge-it.eu<\/a><br><br>We're on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nudgeit_\">@nudgeit_<\/a><br>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"<ul><li><strong>Week 1:<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>Evidence<\/strong>.
