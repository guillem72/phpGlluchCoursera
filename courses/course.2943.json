{"id":2943,"shortName":"bitcointech","name":"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies","language":"en","shortDescription":"There\u2019s a lot of excitement about Bitcoin, but also a lot of confusion about what Bitcoin is and how it works. We\u2019re offering this course focusing on the computer science behind Bitcoin to help cut through the hype and get to the core of what makes Bitcoin unique.\n","aboutTheCourse":"To really understand what is special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works at a technical level. We\u2019ll address the important questions about Bitcoin, such as:<br><br>How does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future hold?<br><br>After this course, you\u2019ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You\u2019ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you\u2019ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.<br><br><strong>Course Lecturers:<\/strong><br>Arvind Narayanan, Princeton University&nbsp;<br>Joseph Bonneau, Princeton University&nbsp;<br>Edward Felten, Princeton University&nbsp;<br>Andrew Miller, University of Maryland<br><br><div><br><\/div>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<b>Intro to Crypto and Cryptocurrencies<\/b><br><ul><li>Cryptographic Hash Functions<\/li><li>Hash Pointers and Data Structures<\/li><li>Digital Signatures<\/li><li>Public Keys as Identities<\/li><li>Simple Cryptocurrencies<\/li><\/ul><b>How Bitcoin Achieves Decentralization<\/b><br><ul><li>Centralization vs. decentralization<\/li><li>Distributed consensus<\/li><li>Consensus without identity: the block chain<\/li><li>Incentives and proof of work<\/li><li>Putting it all together<\/li><\/ul><b>Mechanics of Bitcoin<\/b><br><ul><li>Bitcoin transactions<\/li><li>Bitcoin scripts<\/li><li>Applications of Bitcoin scripts<\/li><li>Bitcoin blocks<\/li><li>The Bitcoin network<\/li><li>Limitations &amp; improvements<\/li><\/ul><b>How to Store and Use Bitcoins<\/b><br><ul><li>Simple Local Storage<\/li><li>How to Store and Use Bitcoins<\/li><li>Secret Keys<\/li><li>Hot and Cold Storage<\/li><li>Splitting and Sharing Keys<\/li><li>Online Wallets and Exchanges<\/li><li>Payment Services<\/li><li>Transaction Fees<\/li><li>Currency Exchange Markets<\/li><\/ul><b>Bitcoin mining<\/b><br><ul><li>The task of Bitcoin miners<\/li><li>Mining hardware<\/li><li>Energy consumption &amp; ecology<\/li><li>Mining pools<\/li><li>Mining incentives and strategies<\/li><\/ul><b>Bitcoin and anonymity<\/b><br><ul><li>Anonymity basics<\/li><li>Overview of Bitcoin deanonymization<\/li><li>Mixing<\/li><li>Decentralized mixing<\/li><li>Zerocoin and Zerocash<\/li><li>Tor and the Silk Road<\/li><\/ul><b>Community, Politics, and Regulation<\/b><br><ul><li>Consensus in Bitcoin<\/li><li>Bitcoin Core Software<\/li><li>Stakeholders : Who\u2019s in Charge?<\/li><li>Roots of Bitcoin<\/li><li>Governments Notice Bitcoin<\/li><li>Anti Money-Laundering Regulation<\/li><li>New York\u2019s BitLicense Proposal<\/li><\/ul><b>Alternative Mining Puzzles<\/b><br><ul><li>Essential Puzzle Requirements<\/li><li>ASIC Resistant Puzzles<\/li><li>Proof-of-useful-work<\/li><li>Nonoutsourceable Puzzles<\/li><li>Proof-of-Stake<\/li><\/ul><b>Bitcoin as a platform<\/b><br><ul><li>Bitcoin as an append-only log<\/li><li>Bitcoins as \u201csmart property\u201d<\/li><li>Secure multi-party lotteries in Bitcoin<\/li><li>Bitcoin as randomness source<\/li><li>Prediction markets &amp; real-world data feeds<\/li><\/ul><b>Altcoins and the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem<\/b><br><ul><li>Short History of Altcoins<\/li><li>Interaction between Bitcoin and altcoins<\/li><li>Lifecycle of an Altcoin<\/li><li>Bitcoin-Backed Altcoins, \u201cSide Chains\u201d<\/li><\/ul><b>The future of Bitcoin?<\/b>&nbsp;<br><ul><li>The block chain as a vehicle for decentralization<\/li><li>Routes to decentralization<\/li><li>What can we decentralize?<\/li><li>When is decentralization a good idea?<\/li><\/ul>","courseFormat":"The class will consist of lecture videos broken up into 5-7 segments, each 10-15 minutes in length.
