    "shortDescription": "In this course, you will learn about software defined networking and how it is changing the way communications networks are managed, maintained, and secured.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>This course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of an entire network. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Separating a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in terms of low-level device configuration. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Logically centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g., security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework, allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and debug.&nbsp;<\/p>",
