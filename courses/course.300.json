Fast-paced introduction to key tools and techniques\n    (command line, dotfiles, text editor, distributed version control, debugging,\n    testing, documentation, reading code, deployments), featuring guest appearances\n    by senior engineers from successful startups and large-scale academic projects.\n    Over the course of the class, students will build a command line application,\n    expose it as a web service, and then link other students' applications\n    and services together to build an HTML5 mobile app. General principles\n    are illustrated through modern Javascript and the latest web technologies,\n    including Node, Backbone, Coffeescript, Bootstrap, Git, and Github.&nbsp;<b><\/b><b><\/b><b><\/b>\n<\/div>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<div><span>The syllabus is optimized to enable students to&nbsp;iterate on their final projects as soon as possible, with technical material in the first half of the class and entrepreneurial considerations&nbsp;in the second half.<br><br><\/span>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n    <li>Introduction and Quickstart<\/li>\n    <li><span>Tools: VMs, IAAS\/PAAS, Unix Command Line, Text Editors, DCVS<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Frontend: HTML\/CSS\/JS, Wireframing, Market Research<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Backend: SSJS, Databases, Frameworks, Data Pipelines<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>APIs: Client-side templating, HTTP, SOA\/REST\/JSON, API as BizDev<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Devops: Testing, Deployment, CI, Monitoring, Performance<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Dev Scaling: DRY, Reading\/Reviewing\/Documenting Code, Parallelizing<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Founding: Conception, Composition, Capitalization<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Business Scaling: Promotion, CAC\/LTV\/Funnel, Regulation, Accounting<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n    <li><span>Summary and Demo Week<br><\/span>\n    <\/li>\n<\/ul>","courseFormat":"<div>The first part of the course will cover modern software engineering&nbsp;principles\n    with a focus on mobile HTML5 development, taught via 5-10&nbsp;minute video\n    lectures with in-video quizzes, programming&nbsp;assignments, and multiple choice questions.&nbsp;Guest\n    lecturers from top Silicon Valley startups will bring these&nbsp;concepts\n    to life with real engineering problems from their work.&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n<\/div>\n<div>In the second part, you will apply these concepts to develop a simple&nbsp;command\n    line application, expose it as a webservice, and then integrate&nbsp;other\n    students' command line apps and webservices together&nbsp;with yours to\n    create an open-source&nbsp;mobile HTML5 app as a final project. &nbsp;Lectures\n    will continue&nbsp;in the second part, but will be focused&nbsp;on the\n    design, marketing, and logistical aspects of creating and&nbsp;scaling\n    a startup.
