There's something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry.","aboutTheCourse":"Why is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so important? Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his\/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?<br><br>Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population. <br><br>In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.<br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<strong>Dairy Genetics (1 week)<br><\/strong>Dairy breeds and performance differences among breeds; sire proofs and genetic evaluations; selection objectives and the prioritization of traits; long term genetic trends and the effect of genomic selection in elite and commercial dairy farms.<strong><br><br><\/strong><strong>Forage, Production and Pasture Management<\/strong><strong> (1 week)<\/strong><br>Forage production and the multiple roles that forage crops play on the dairy farm; production practices for both annual and perennial forages and the key management considerations that are necessary for optimizing the forage yield and quality of these crops on dairy farms; grazing and pasture management, including challenges of grazing systems, how grazing management has evolved, and proper grazing management for optimum forage and animal productivity.<br><br><strong>Dairy Nutrition<\/strong><strong> (2 weeks)<br><\/strong>Common terminology and basic principles of ruminant nutrition, characteristics of dairy forages, concentrate feeds, and feed additives, silage-making, and processing of feeds; specifics about animal requirements and recommended feeding practices and diet formulation basics for various categories of dairy cattle, including dry and lactating cows and young stock.<strong><br><br>Dairy Reproduction<\/strong><strong> (1 week)<\/strong><br>Begins with the birth of a heifer calf and moves to discussion of the factors that contribute to growth, development and longevity of this animal in the milking herd.
