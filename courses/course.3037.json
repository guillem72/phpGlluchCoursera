    "courseSyllabus": "<strong>Week 1 - First Images<\/strong><br>Introduces the first photographic processes, unveiled in 1839 - the daguerreotype, by Parisian Louis Jacque Mandé Daguerre\nand the calotype, by Englishman WHF Talbot, which Hill &amp; Adamson used to produce around 3,000 images between 1843 and 1848.<br><strong><\/strong><strong><br><\/strong><strong>Week 2 - 1851: A Year to Remember&nbsp;<\/strong><br>With the Great Exhibition in London and two major milestones in the development of photography: first, stereoscopy, the 3D sensation and&nbsp; second, the new, faster wet collodion process that made outdoor photography much easier.<br><br><strong>Week 3 -&nbsp;Studio Photography, Amateur Photography<\/strong>&nbsp;<br>In 1851 there had\nbeen about a dozen photographic studios in London; by 1866 this number had\nincreased to 284.&nbsp; Photography became\nextremely fashionable, particularly in the new carte-de-visite and stereo\nforms.&nbsp; Amateur photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, photographed the writers, artists, scientists in her social circle.<br><br><strong>Week 4 - Stereo Sensation&nbsp;<\/strong><br>Following the\npresentation of the lenticular stereoscopic viewer at the Great Exhibition,\nviewing the world in 3D became a Victorian craze. The experience of\nusing a stereoscope was described as ‘mesmerising’. The London\nStereoscopic Company, formed in 1854, had as its slogan: ‘no home without a\nstereoscope’. <br><br><strong>Week 5 - Photography for Everyone<\/strong><br>We\nlook at how photography rapidly moves from an expensive, amateur hobby, to\nreaching the masses, with the growth of cheap ‘tintypes’ and beach photography,\nand end with the impact of the Kodak camera, marketed with the slogan \"You press the button and we do the rest\". <br>",
