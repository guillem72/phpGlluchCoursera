    "aboutTheCourse": "<b><\/b>We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of\nnetworks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to\naddress the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities\nis undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical\ntools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to\nengage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology\nfrom a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving\nour cities.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump\ninto how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and&nbsp;the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nStudents will be examining tools for analyzing the city.&nbsp;Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city.<br><br><br><br>All lectures and instructional materials developed for this course by the Ohio State University are licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
