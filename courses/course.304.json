Explore the sweeping changes that our cities are undergoing as a result of networks, sensors, and communication technology.","aboutTheCourse":"<b><\/b>We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of\nnetworks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to\naddress the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities\nis undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical\ntools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to\nengage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology\nfrom a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving\nour cities.\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump\ninto how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and\u00a0the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents will be examining tools for analyzing the city.\u00a0Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<b><u>Week One -&nbsp;Foundations of the&nbsp;<\/u><\/b><b><u>TechniCity<\/u><\/b>\n\n<br>Understand the foundations of the TechniCity and what it means to be a city planner.<br><b><u><br>Week Two -&nbsp;<\/u><\/b><b><u>Infrastructure for the&nbsp;<\/u><\/b><b><u>TechniCity<\/u><\/b><br>You'll learn how sensors and networks are transforming our cities.&nbsp;<b><u><br><br>Week Three -&nbsp;Engaging the&nbsp;<\/u><\/b><b><u>TechniCity<\/u><\/b>\n\n<br>Through social networking and crowdsourcing platforms you'll learn how to engage in city building.<b><u><br><br>Week Four -&nbsp;Entrepreneurial Urbanism<\/u><\/b><u>&nbsp;<br><\/u>You'll\nexplore how open data initiatives, hack-a-thons, and urban prototyping\nfestivals are creatively innovating our cities.\n<p><b><u>Weeks Five &amp; Six -&nbsp;Analyzing the&nbsp;TechniCity<\/u><\/b><br>From&nbsp;sentiment&nbsp;analysis to mashups, you'll experiment with analyzing data.<b><u><br><br>Week Seven \u2013&nbsp;Leading TechniCities<\/u><\/b><u>&nbsp;<br><\/u>Explore how cities across the globe are using Technology to advance their future.<\/p><p><b><u>Week Eight-&nbsp;The Future of the TechniCity<\/u><\/b><u>&nbsp;<br><\/u>You'll engage in peer evaluation of your fellow classmates projects and participate in lively discussion around the future of the TechniCity.<\/p>","courseFormat":"<p>This course is your salon, a gathering of people under the roof of inspiring hosts (your instructors), held partly to amuse each other and partly to refine our collective taste and increase the knowledge of the course participants through conversation.&nbsp;<\/p><div><span>We will have lecture videos varying in length of up to 20 minutes.
