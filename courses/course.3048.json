    "shortDescription": "In this course, we will see how evolutionary trees resolve quandaries from finding the origin of a deadly virus to locating the birthplace of modern humans. We will then use methods from computational proteomics to test whether we can reconstruct Tyrannosaurus rex proteins and prove that birds evolved from dinosaurs.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "In 2003, the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus caused panic as it swept around the globe in a few weeks. But where did SARS come from? By constructing an <strong>evolutionary tree<\/strong> of the unknown virus as well as viruses taken from other species, we can not only understand which animal gave us SARS, but also reconstruct its path around the globe. This is just one of many problems in modern biology related to constructing evolutionary trees.<br><div><br><\/div><div>In 2007, a team of biologists announced that some proteins had miraculously survived within a 68 million year old dinosaur fossil. Moreover, they concluded that the amino acid sequences of these dinosaur proteins were nearly identical to sequences in modern-day chickens. Based on this discovery, famed paleontologist Jack Horner (who inspired the character of Dr. Grant from Jurassic Park) hopes to resurrect dinosaurs by genetically re-engineering a chicken. &nbsp;But did these peptides really come from T. rex? To answer this question, we will need to explore the field of <strong>computational proteomics<\/strong>.<br><br>In the end of the course, a Bioinformatics Application Challenge&nbsp;will let you apply popular bioinformatics software tools to construct an evolutionary tree of different Ebola viruses and hypothesize where the 2014 Ebola outbreak came from.<br><\/div>",
