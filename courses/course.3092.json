The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals. ",

Brands are\nthus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing\nbusiness strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.<\/p><p>You will learn and practice the following skills:<\/p><p>\n\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>How to lead brand-led\nculture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a\nlever and not just an outcome)&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and\ngeographies<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets.&nbsp;<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span><strong>Who?<\/strong> <\/span><\/p><p><span>This course is designed for a broad audience of marketing\nand non-marketing professionals, in particular human resources and finance but\nextending to all employees who need to understand their critical role in\ndelivering on the brand promise.
