{"id":3187,"shortName":"graphene","name":"Graphene and 2-dimensional Materials","language":"en","shortDescription":"Gain a foundational understanding of the world of 2-dimensional materials, including Graphene. This course provides an overview of this exciting new field of study, starting with the concept of what a 2-dimensional material is, how they are produced, their unique and superlative properties, and the range of potential applications.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>The new field of 2-dimensional (2-d) materials has seen\nexponential growth since the isolation of graphene, a single atomic layer of\ncarbon atoms, at University of Manchester in 2004. What is a 2-d material, and\nhow is it different to 3-dimensional materials that we encounter every day? How\ndoes the 2-d nature affect the material\u2019s properties, for instance, how do\nelectrons living in a 2-d world behave? How would we harness the unique\nproperties of 2-d materials and put them to use in real-world applications? We\nwill answer these questions and more in this course on Graphene and other 2-d\nmaterials. <\/p>\n\nThe course will describe how a number of key\naspects of the broader field of nanomaterials are applied to study 2-d\nmaterials, including methods of production such as chemical vapour deposition,\ncharacterisation techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy,\nand the production of nano-electronic and nano-composite structures.<br><br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<strong>Week 1: Introduction<\/strong>\n\n<ul><li>What is graphene?
