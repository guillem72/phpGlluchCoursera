    "shortDescription": "An ambitious global development agenda was adopted at a UN Summit on September 25, 2015. The new global goals, called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will require trillions of dollars to accomplish over the next 15 years. This magnitude of financing will surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors. The World Bank Group and its partners recognize the need to leverage the “billions” in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to attract and mobilize “trillions” in investments of all kinds: public and private, national and global, in both capital and capacity.",

The Module also touches upon the outgoing general framework for development , the MDGs of 2000-2015, and the successor SDGs covering the period 2016-2030 adopted in September.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<strong>Week 2: Public Finance<\/strong><br>\nThe second Module introduces and explains domestic and international public finance resources.  It highlights issues such as improving domestic resource mobilization, increasing the efficiency of public expenditure measures such as reducing illicit financial flows, and better leveraging Official Development Assistance to enhance its ability to mobilize other sources of public and private finance , particularly for low-income and fragile economies. The Module also discusses the importance for countries  to improve the investment climate for greater private investment and to foster development of domestic capital markets to facilitate the tapping of domestic savings for development uses.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Week 3: Private and Commercial Finance<\/strong><br>\nThe third Module focuses on sources of domestic and international private and commercial finance. It includes the substantial growth of foreign direct and portfolio investments and of domestic capital markets in select developing countries. It emphasizes the growth and potential of newer sources of private and commercial finance, such as philanthropic funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and private equity, to be “crowded in” by more targeted use of public resources. It highlights challenges and obstacles the private sector sees to greater mobilization of private sector funding, including needed incentives such as greater risk-sharing and a more hospitable regulatory environment. This Module spotlights infrastructure finance, as one of the most resource-intensive and pervasive development sectors across the developing world, discussing the needs and the current impediments to attracting the capital projected to be required to meet those needs.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Week 4: The Financing Role of the Multilateral Development Banks, and Wrap Up<\/strong><br>\nThe fourth Module provides an overview of the MDBs, explaining their business models that have allowed them to leverage their capital and equity to support a vastly greater portfolio of development projects worldwide. It also discusses innovative financing solutions used in recent years to mobilize and generate new financing flows and improve the efficient use of available funds. This Module also highlights the role of MDBs in financing global public goods (GPGs), with climate finance spotlighted as a prime example of innovative techniques and financing vehicles used to ramp up funding deployed in this critical and global area. This Module concludes with a wrap-up of the key learnings the course has attempted to convey.<br>\n<br>\n \n\n<h2>Course Tracks<\/h2>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/fin4devmooc\/images\/course-tracks.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0px 0 10px; width:275px;\" alt=\"\">\nParticipants can participate in one of two tracks:<br><br>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>General Awareness<\/li>\n<li>Development Specialist<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nParticipants can move from the General Awareness to the Development Specialist Track at any time during the course.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Track 1 – General Awareness<\/strong><br><br>\n \n\n<ul><strong>Target Audience<\/strong><br>\nThis Track is suitable for anyone with a general interest in and desire to increase understanding of development finance, in particular the need to scale up to meet the financing needs supporting achievement of the SDGs and development more generally.<br>\n <br>\n<strong>Common Objective<\/strong><br>\nTo describe the fundamental concepts of development finance, the sources of funding, and the role of finance in supporting the new Sustainable Development Agenda and development generally.
