","aboutTheCourse":"<div>Can a MOOC be a work of art? New York\u2019s public art organization, Creative Time, and Duke University believe it can. &nbsp;Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch, and co-taught with Creative Time chief curator, Nato Thompson, ART of the MOOC functions simultaneously as a socially-engaged public art form and a survey course on that very subject. &nbsp;Taking full advantage of the global scale yet intimate environment that only a MOOC can offer, this course merges traditional classroom practices with new technology and aesthetic experimentation. &nbsp;Video lectures, complementary materials, and presentations by cross-national artists, curators, critics, and activists provide a formal and theoretical overview of the fundamental themes within socially-engaged public art. &nbsp;Interspersed with these lessons, students will contribute to the field by completing creative assignments and participating in collective art projects. &nbsp;Online forums and opportunities to assemble outside of class will allow students to share their activities while developing critical thinking and discussion skills. &nbsp;Through this hands-on, participatory approach, ART of the MOOC welcomes students as collaborators in an unprecedented expression of public art and education.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>In addition to Lasch and Thompson, students will be learning from the following list of guest presenters:<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>\u2022\t<strong>Tania Bruguera<\/strong> is an installation and performance artist who frequently addresses the political climate in Cuba and the world, and also the founder of the Hannah Arendt International Institute for Artivism.<\/div><div>\u2022\t<strong>Sean Dockray<\/strong> is an artist, researcher, founding director of the Los Angeles non-profit Telic Arts Exchange, and initiator of knowledge-sharing platforms, The Public School and Aaaaarg.<\/div><div>\u2022\t<strong>Claire Doherty<\/strong> is a curator, writer, and educator interested in temporary, place-based art and unconventional curatorial practices.

We will examine the critical role that such practices have had in relation to various forms of urbanism and social planning and consider the physical and symbolic mechanisms that separate the global and the local, the urban and the rural, the visible and the invisible, citizens and immigrants, settlers and refugees.

From Freire and Boal to Judy Chicago and Miriam Shapiro\u2019s Womanhouse and the CalArts Feminist Art Program a brief review of experimental or radical pedagogy and its influence on art is hence the focus of this lesson. Using various technologies and social forms, some of these works set out to transform education from within. Others intentionally position themselves as self-organized platforms outside of institutions. Our focus will be on how the production of alternative communities of learning can challenge the hierarchies, professionalization, homogenization, and economy of current education systems. This week\u2019s practical components will invite students to rethink their relationship to education as they chose between small-scale socialization and massive collaboration.<\/div><div>Guest presenters: <strong>Tania Bruguera, Sean Dockray, Suzanne Lacy,&nbsp;<\/strong><b>Cesare Pietroiusti<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><strong>Week 3: Fictions, Alternative Structures, and Mock-Institutions (Lasch &amp; Thompson)<\/strong><\/div><div>By definition, social art is a collective endeavor. It might seek to transform larger social structures and economies. Perhaps more modestly, it might offer some alternatives or simply confront immediate challenges. The production of an unusual, creative, or engaged collective body can be its final goal. In this lesson we will learn how socially engaged artists have used the guise or actual form of organizations and institutions such as churches, corporations, banks, government offices, and other social units as the very media of their work. This lesson\u2019s practical components will ask students to invent their own alternative social structures or fictional interventions.<\/div><div>Guest presenters: <strong>Fran Ilich,&nbsp;<\/strong><b>Cesare Pietroiusti,&nbsp;<\/b><strong>Ruangrupa,&nbsp;<\/strong><b>Greg Sholette,&nbsp;<\/b><strong>Caroline Woolard<\/strong><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><strong>Week 4: Aesthetics, Art History, and Cultural Institutions (Lasch &amp; Thompson)<\/strong><\/div><div>Starting with an exploration of the ways in which socially engaged public art has been included and excluded from particular narratives, theories, institutions, and events, we will use this lesson to follow social practices as they question conventional art and art history. As we do so, students will be invited to create projects that directly engage with Cultivating, Farming, Cooking, or Eating\u2014activities that are fundamentally social but traditionally seen to contradict serious artistic production.<\/div><div>Guest presenters: <strong>Chido Govera, Hans Haacke, Future Farmers,&nbsp;<\/strong><b>Shannon Jackson,&nbsp;<\/b><strong>Jolene Rickard, Abigail Satinsky<\/strong><\/div><div><br><\/div><div><strong>Week 5: Embodied Knowledges (Lasch)<\/strong><\/div><div>This lesson will use the notion of \u2018embodied knowledges\u2019 to link socially engaged art to performance art, gesture, and \u2018writing without words.\u2019 Recognizing that knowledge is inseparable from ones lived, physical, and social experience, \u2018embodied knowledges\u201d challenge the Western paradigms that separate information from matter, reason from affect, mind from the body, the worker from her labor, the individual from the collective.

Environmentalism, AIDS activism, Queer movements, Zapatismo, immigrant rallies, alter-globalization, the World Social Forum, Occupy, the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, museum boycotts, and democratic uprisings in the Middle East will be seen in dialogue with cultural producers who participate in these movements or are inspired by them. Rather than assess the political efficacy of such cultural activities, we will examine their place within contemporary art practices. Based on Listening, Organizing, Dancing, or Partying, each student\u2019s contribution will respond to &nbsp;a particular social movement of their choosing.<\/div><div>Guest presenters: <strong>Beka Economopoulos, Gulf Labor, Rebecca Gomperts, Leonidas Martin, Naeem Mohaiemen, Joshua Wong<\/strong><\/div>","courseFormat":"<div><div>This course consists of short video lectures by Lasch and Thompson, complemented by video presentations and interviews with important figures related to each module. To best ensure learning comprehension, students will complete short multiple choice quizzes before moving on to produce their own projects inspired by the weekly topics. As the primary focus of the ART of the MOOC, the projects are based on simple prompts presented in weekly instructional videos. In the prompts, Lasch also discusses related processes. Students chose which of two options best matches their interests. No previous art or social practice experience is required. This approach to learning through practice is the ART of the MOOC's primary artistic and experimental component. Working alone and collectively on projects transforms students into active participants of an unprecedented experiment in art and education. All works will be graded through a peer evaluations process. Some will be highlighted in forums with the instructors and guest presenters. Others may be presented in professional settings like the Creative Time Summit in New York on November 14-15, 2015.
