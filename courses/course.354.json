This course will examine and explain the business of sports by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various sports industries. The primary focus will be on American team sports but comparative global models will be contemplated as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will seek to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports entities learn from each other? What business strategies are used to improve the profitability of leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons can be drawn from the United States-based sports models? What revised models should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive instruction will be drawn from the likes of the NFL, MLB, English Premier League, Bundesliga, various player unions, India and much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, our goal is to equip the student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.<\/p>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Module One: Introduction to Professional Sports <\/strong>I<\/p><p>Where is the Money?&nbsp;&nbsp;This module will begin with a focus on the reasons why people are drawn to the sports industry and the built-in advantages that that affinity provides.
