    "shortDescription": "This course will provide the scientific basis for caries (dental decay) risk assessment and practice interventions.  You will immediately be able to apply “caries management by risk assessment” into your clinical setting or into your personal health care.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses\nwhen acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates\ntravels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.\n This process is<span> called demineralization.<br>\n<br>\nPathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and\ndietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors, which include\nantibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and\nfluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a\nprocess of remineralization. \nRemineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for\nnon-cavitated carious lesions.<br>\n<br>\nThis course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance”\nconcept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical\npractice.  If pathological factors\nprevail caries progresses.  If protective\nfactors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.<br>\n<br>\nThe course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA, “caries management by risk assessment,”\nin your clinical setting.  It can be in\nimplemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of\nall ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope\nand success for the management of their oral health.  It is a practice builder for dentistry.<\/span>",
