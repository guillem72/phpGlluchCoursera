You will immediately be able to apply \u201ccaries management by risk assessment\u201d into your clinical setting or into your personal health care.","aboutTheCourse":"Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses\nwhen acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates\ntravels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.\n\u00a0This process is<span> called demineralization.<br>\n<br>\nPathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and\ndietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.\u00a0 Protective factors, which include\nantibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and\nfluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a\nprocess of remineralization.\u00a0\nRemineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for\nnon-cavitated carious lesions.<br>\n<br>\nThis course will provide the scientific basis behind the \u201ccaries balance\u201d\nconcept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical\npractice.\u00a0 If pathological factors\nprevail caries progresses.\u00a0 If protective\nfactors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.<br>\n<br>\nThe course will present tools to implement \u00a0CAMBRA, \u201ccaries management by risk assessment,\u201d\nin your clinical setting.\u00a0 It can be in\nimplemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of\nall ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope\nand success for the management of their oral health.\u00a0 It is a practice builder for dentistry.<\/span>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<b>Week 1:<\/b><br><ul><li>Understand what dental caries is<\/li><li>Understand the concept of the caries balance<\/li><li>Know the three principal pathological factors of caries formation<\/li><li>Understand that multiple bacterial species are responsible for dental caries<\/li><li>Understand the role of frequent ingestion of fermentable carbohydrates in dental caries<\/li><li>Recognize hyposalivation, how this occurs, and its importance in caries progression<\/li><\/ul><b>Week 2:<\/b><br><ul><li>Refine the concept of the caries balance\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know and understand the multiple caries protective components in saliva<\/li><li>Understand demineralization and the role of fluoride<\/li><li>Understand remineralization and the role of fluoride\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><b>Week 3:<\/b><br><ul><li>Understand remineralization and the role of fluoride\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Understand how fluoride interacts with cariogenic bacteria\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know the three main mechanisms of action of fluoride\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know about fluoride toothpastes and fluoride mouthrinses<\/li><\/ul><b>Week 4:<\/b><br><ul><li>Know about fluoride products for the dental office and for home use by prescription\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know why high concentration fluoride products are used for high caries risk individuals\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know the antibacterial products currently available for caries control\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Understand the root caries process including similarities and differences with coronal caries<\/li><\/ul><b>Week 5:\u00a0<\/b><br><ul><li>Understand the distinction among disease indicators, pathological (biological risk) factors, and protective factors<br><\/li><li>Know that the CAMBRA risk assessment method is validated in clinical use in thousands of patients for 6 years through adult<\/li><li>Know the bacterial assessment methods<\/li><li>Understand the sequence for the entire CAMBRA method\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><b>Week 6:<\/b><ul><li>Know how to assess caries risk for an individual as low, moderate, high, or extreme\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Know the currently recommended chemical therapy for patients at low, moderate, high, or extreme risk\u00a0<br><\/li><li>To study numerous examples of risk assessment and therapy and how to build this into the treatment plan\u00a0<br><\/li><li>Understand the differences between risk assessment for young children, older children, and adults\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>","courseFormat":"The class will consist of lecture videos, containing integrated quiz questions\nfor review and additional features to prepare the learner to practice CAMBRA.\nStudents will be asked to participate in discussion forums, and use their\nforum posts as the basis for peer-reviewed writing assignments.
