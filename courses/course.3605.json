It is a convergence point for multidisciplinary work from many disciplines. Psychologists, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, neuroscientists, medical researchers, behavioral scientists, engineers, public health researchers, biologists, and others are coming together to advance our understanding of the human mind and brain. &nbsp;In this course we continue discussing fMRI, including advanced experimental design, analysis, and inferences about brain and mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;We discuss both theoretical considerations and practical aspects of conducting fMRI studies, with an emphasis on statistical analysis. &nbsp;The course is appropriate for scholars from all disciplines who want to learn more about fMRI, and for researchers engaged in fMRI studies. &nbsp;<\/span>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<span><p dir=\"ltr\"><ul><li>Psychological and behavioral inference<br><\/li><li>Advanced experimental design<br><\/li><li>Advanced GLM modeling<br><\/li><li>Functional connectivity<br><\/li><li>Effective connectivity and directional models<br><\/li><li>Multi-voxel pattern analysis<br><\/li><\/ul><\/p><\/span>","courseFormat":"Each module of the course consists of a series of short lectures followed by a quiz.","suggestedReadings":"The book \u201cPrinciples of fMRI\u201d by Wager &amp; Lindquist is recommended","estimatedClassWorkload":"4-6 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/fmri1\" target=\"_blank\">Principles of fMRI 1<\/a>","links":{}}
