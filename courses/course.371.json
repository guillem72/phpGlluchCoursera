{"id":371,"shortName":"oldglobe","name":"Growing Old Around the Globe","language":"en","shortDescription":"The world is ageing \u2013 people are older and societies are facing hard realities.  What are we to make our lives in this time of global ageing? In six weeks, we analyze critical questions about age and ageing around the world.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>Growing old is discussed today in ominous terms \u2013 concerns about disease,\n    dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers.\n    What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an\n    ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social\n    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored\n    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences\n    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,\n    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile\n    a portfolio of materials they create and\/or collect to address each week\u2019s\n    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout\n    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course\n    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.<\/p>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"<p><strong>\n\n<\/strong><b>Week Zero: How do I\ncritically appraise information about ageing?<\/b><\/p><div><\/div><p>Key Concepts:<\/p><ul><li>Resources<\/li><li>Evaluation<\/li><li>Interpretation<\/li><li>Application<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><p><b>Week One: &nbsp;&nbsp;What is ageing?<\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Key Concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Biology and senescence<\/li><li>\n    Psychological ageing<\/li>\n    <li>Social ageing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br>\n<p><b>Week Two: &nbsp;&nbsp;What is it to be old?<\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Key Concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Familial and filial structure<\/li>\n    <li>Functional status<\/li>\n    <li>Social welfare\/well being<\/li>\n    <li>Ageing in place<\/li>\n    <li>Longevity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><br><\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Week Three: &nbsp; What is an ageing society?<\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Key Concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Ageing population (birth rate decline and longevity increase)<\/li>\n    <li>Elder dependency<\/li>\n    <li>Generativity<\/li>\n    <li>Gerontocracy<\/li>\n    <li>Gero-economics<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><br><\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Week Four: &nbsp; What is it to age well?<\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Key Concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Usual and successful ageing<\/li>\n    <li>Healthy ageing<\/li>\n    <li>Well being<\/li>\n    <li>Quality of life<\/li>\n    <li>Spirituality and ageing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><br><\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Week Five: &nbsp;What are the global implications of ageing?<\/b>\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Key Concepts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Ageing workforce<\/li>\n    <li>Caregiving workforce<\/li>\n    <li>Migration<\/li>\n    <li>Public health<\/li>\n    <li>Public policy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br><b>Week Six: &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/b><b>What do ageing societies need to do to prepare\nfor the future?<\/b>\n\n<p>Key Concepts:\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Human resources<\/li>\n    <li>Financial resources<\/li>\n    <li>Cultural precepts<\/li>\n    <li>Ethical principles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the full syllabus, click <a href=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/oldglobe\/OldGlobe2%20Syllabus%20%20032114%20%281%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">here<\/a>.\n<\/p>","courseFormat":"<ul>\n    <li>Video segments with expert commentary<\/li>\n    <li>Documentary video segments with field video from around the world<\/li>\n    <li>Live webcast discussion<\/li>\n    <li>Online discussion thread<\/li>\n<\/ul>","suggestedReadings":"International Labour Union article on ageing societies: The benefits,\nand the costs, of living longer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/global\/publications\/magazines-and-journals\/world-of-work-magazine\/articles\/WCM_041965\/lang--en\/index.htm\">http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/global\/publications\/magazines-and-journals\/world-of-work-magazine\/articles\/WCM_04...<\/a>\n\n<br>\n<br>New Old Age Blog at NYT: <a href=\"http:\/\/newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com\/ \" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com\/<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com\/ \" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\n<br>\n<br>UN Global Issues Ageing Overview and Related Links <a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/globalissues\/ageing\/ \" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/globalissues\/ageing\/<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/globalissues\/ageing\/ \" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\n<br>\n<br>WHO Health Topics Ageing:\n<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/topics\/ageing\/en\/\">http:\/\/www.who.int\/topics\/ageing\/en\/<\/a>","instructor":"Sarah Kagan and Anne Shoemaker","estimatedClassWorkload":"5-10 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"No background in ageing or related fields is required.
