    "shortDescription": "Students will learn the process of drug discovery and development through specific examples of case studies to better understand the issues facing the challenges of delivering a new drug on the market. At the completion of this course you will be able to have a better understanding of how a small or large molecule becomes a pharmaceutical drug.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "The University of California San Diego, Skaggs School of Pharmacy&nbsp;and\nPharmaceutical Sciences Drug Discovery, Development &amp; Commercialization\ncourse focuses on drug discovery, development and commercialization.&nbsp;\n<br>In this course, you will learn about the complete process of drug discovery,\ndevelopment, pharmacoeconomics, biosimilars, regulatory affairs, managed\nmarkets,&nbsp;portfolio management and strategic marketing of a new pharmaceutical\ndrug. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Students will also learn that shifting the current drug discovery paradigm\nfrom ‘finding new-entity drugs’ to ‘combining existing agents’ may be helpful\nfor overcoming the current financial challenges that exist in the pharmaceutical\/biotech\nmarket.&nbsp;\n<p>The following course objectives will be:<\/p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;Understand the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market a changing\n    landscape<\/p>\n<p>2. Understand the major aspects of the drug discovery process, starting\n    with target selection, to compound screening to designing lead candidates.\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>3. Recognize current modern drug discovery based on the lock-and-key theory,\n    which attempts to use one single compound to hit one target to combat the\n    related disease.<\/p>\n<p>4. Increase understanding of the various drug discovery tools and methods\n    that are used for finding, identifying and designing a new drug.<\/p>\n<p>5. Define and understand the regulatory responsibilities for drug discovery,\n    including but not limited to, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND),\n    New Drug Application (NDA), and product labeling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;6. Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design\n    of clinical protocols to access safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple\n    therapeutic areas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;7. Identify the critical components for development of a commercialization\n    strategy and a marketing plan to launch a new drug.<\/p>",
