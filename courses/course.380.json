{"id":380,"shortName":"socialepi","name":"Social Epidemiology","language":"en","shortDescription":"Social epidemiology is about how a society makes people sick and\/or healthy. We address not only the identification of new disease risk factors (e.g., deficient social capital) but also how well-known exposures (e.g., cigarette smoking, lead paint, health insurance) emerge and are maintained by the social system.","aboutTheCourse":"This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad\nperspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such\nas familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces\n-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing\nevidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant\nto the topic.\n<br>\n<br>The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental\ncauses of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.\nFor example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people\ndifferently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is\na narrowly defined medical problem.\n<br>\n<br>Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,\nand complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability\nto synthesize ideas.\n<br>\n<br><span>Upon completion of the course students should:<br><\/span>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health\n        of populations,<\/li>\n    <li>be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature\n        that address the causes of disease,<\/li>\n    <li>be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status,\n        and&nbsp;<\/li>\n    <li>be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical\n        for policy making.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1: &nbsp;Background and History\n<br>What is social epidemiology and where did it come from?

Each lecture will\nbe made up of 2-4 video modules or parts. Each of the video modules will\nbe about 8-12 minutes in length.\n<br>\n<br>Most of the video modules (i.e., parts of the lectures) will have a mini\nquiz of one or two multiple choice questions. There will also be standalone\nreadings and (group) homework assignments that are not part of video lectures.\nAdditionally, there will be an overall lecture quiz for each of the seven\nlectures. This overall quiz will have approximately 10 multiple choice\nquestions in it. There will not be a final exam.\n<br>","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Michael  Oakes","estimatedClassWorkload":"2-4 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"Students should be curious, enthusiastic&nbsp;readers, with undergraduate-level&nbsp;analytical\nand critical thinking&nbsp;skills; and&nbsp;have an interest in&nbsp;policy\nimplications surrounding social and societal&nbsp;health issues.
