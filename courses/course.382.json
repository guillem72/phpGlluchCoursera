    "shortDescription": "This course examines the implications of informatics for practice, in nursing, public health, and healthcare in general. It covers electronic health record issues and relates ethical, legislative and political issues to health informatics. Students will also explore global and future informatics issues.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Interprofessional health care informatics is a graduate-level, hands-on interactive exploration of real informatics tools and techniques. We will be incorporating technology-enabled educational innovations to bring the subject matter to life. Over the\n10 weeks that we study together, we will create a vital online learning community and a working healthcare informatics network.\n<br>\n<br>We will explore perspectives of clinicians like dentists, physical therapists, nurses, and physicians in all sorts of practice settings worldwide. Emerging technologies, telehealth, gaming, simulations, and eScience are just some of the topics that we\nwill consider.\n<br>\n<br>Throughout the course, weâ€™ll focus on creativity, controversy, and collaboration - as we collectively imagine and create the future within the rapidly evolving healthcare informatics milieu. All healthcare professionals and IT geeks are welcome!\n<br>",
