We will also examine the challenges and opportunities of creating a more sustainable global food system in the future.","aboutTheCourse":"Hamburger or hummus? Organic or conventional? Mediterranean&nbsp;diet or&nbsp;McDonald's? What dietary choices are truly the most sustainable when&nbsp;we consider that what we eat affects not just our health but also the&nbsp;environment and the well-being of others?<br><br>This course will provide you with an overview of our world\u2019s&nbsp;food system&nbsp;and its many impacts from the individual to the global scale. You&nbsp;will&nbsp;gain further appreciation of the complex implications of&nbsp;choices that are made&nbsp;along the food&nbsp;supply chain. You&nbsp;will be challenged to think critically about how the&nbsp;global food system may&nbsp;need to change to adapt to future economic&nbsp;and environmental conditions.<br><br>Our world\u2019s population is projected to grow both in numbers and in wealth in the coming decades. Meeting future food demand, and doing so in a sustainable fashion, will require that we greatly increase the amount&nbsp;we produce and improve the efficiency by which it makes it to our tables.&nbsp;Join us as we explore today\u2019s global food system and how we might improve its sustainability for our benefit and that of future generations.<br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"This course is organized around fifteen questions that span our world's food system, its impacts, and its future.<br><br><ol><li>What&nbsp;is food?<\/li><li>What&nbsp;foods do we eat?<\/li><li>How&nbsp;and where did our food originate?<br><\/li><li>How&nbsp;and where do we grow our food?<br><\/li><li>How do&nbsp;we facilitate the trade and transfer of our food?<br><\/li><li>How do&nbsp;we process and distribute our food?<br><\/li><li>How do&nbsp;we prepare our food?<br><\/li><li>How do&nbsp;we choose what to eat?<\/li><li>How do&nbsp;we assess the sustainability of the global food system?<\/li><li>How&nbsp;does what we eat affect our health?<br><\/li><li>How&nbsp;does what we eat affect our environment?<br><\/li><li>How&nbsp;much food will we need in the future?<br><\/li><li>What&nbsp;challenges do we face in reforming the global food system?<br><\/li><li>How&nbsp;can we provide more food more sustainably?<\/li><li>How can we each contribute to a more sustainable&nbsp;global food system?<br><\/li><\/ol>","courseFormat":"You will investigate current topics in&nbsp;food&nbsp;sustainability and have the opportunity to participate in discussions&nbsp;with your colleagues, who themselves will be from all over the&nbsp;world.&nbsp;Other members of the University of Minnesota faculty with expertise in these areas will assist us in answering the questions around which the course is organized.&nbsp;Case studies, readings, and other resources will&nbsp;emphasize&nbsp;that responsible decisions about what to&nbsp;eat require that&nbsp;we&nbsp;consider the entire global food supply chain and its full set&nbsp;of economic,&nbsp;environmental, and social consequences.<br>","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Jason Hill","estimatedClassWorkload":"3-4 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"No background is required.","links":{}}
