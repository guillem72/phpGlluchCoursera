{"id":384,"shortName":"introthermodynamics","name":"Introduction to Thermodynamics: Transferring Energy from Here to There","language":"en","shortDescription":"In this course, you will learn how to characterize the energy state of a system and the mechanisms for transferring energy from one system to another.  These are the tools necessary to understand stationary and transportation power systems from small scale, like batteries, to large scale, like nuclear power plants.","aboutTheCourse":"<div>This course will provide you with an introduction to the most powerful\n    engineering principles you will ever learn: thermodynamics! Or the science\n    of transferring energy from one place or form to another place or form.\n    &nbsp;We will introduce the tools you need to analyze energy systems from\n    solar panels, to engines, to insulated coffee mugs.<\/div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n<\/div>\n<div>More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass and energy conservation\n    principles; first law analysis of control mass and control volume systems;\n    properties and behavior of pure substances; and applications to thermodynamic\n    systems operating at steady state conditions.&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n<\/div>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<a href=\"https:\/\/d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net\/introthermodynamics\/documents\/introthermodynamics_syllabus.V6.053014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View the Syllabus<\/a>","courseFormat":"The class consists of lecture videos, which are typically 8 and 12 minutes\nin length. The videos include several integrated quiz questions per video.\nThere are also homework problems to practice your analytical skills that\nare not part of video lectures.There are no exams.","suggestedReadings":"<b>Free textbooks and online resources:<\/b>\n\n<br>\n<br>1.
