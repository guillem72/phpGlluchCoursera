As a dog enthusiast, you want to know what is best for your dog and to understand your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations. This course is intended to give you the background knowledge necessary to help you achieve those goals. <br><br>Students in this course will learn the basics of anatomy and reproductive physiology necessary to understand reproduction control, and the diagnosis and management of reproductive tract disease in male and female dogs. My goal is to provide you with background information that will help you work with your veterinarian to make the best decisions for your dog.<br><br><br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1: Female dog anatomy \/ The estrous cycle<br><br>Week 2: Breeding management \/\u00a0Pregnancy and whelping<br><br>Week 3: Female dog reproductive tract disorders<br><br>Week 4: Male dog anatomy \/ Semen collection and evaluation \/ Artificial insemination<br><br>Week 5: Male dog reproductive tract disorders<br><br>Week 6: Contraception and sterilization of female and male dogs<br><br>","courseFormat":"I will start each session with a case for you to think about, provide a couple of brief video lectures (5-15 minutes in length) followed by short activities\u00a0to check your understanding. We'll conclude each session with a review of the most important points and an explanation of the case with which we started. For more advanced students, a question will be posted that will require you to find\u00a0your own resources.\u00a0I will also provide\u00a0references\u00a0to written materials that may help you better understand the concepts or to learn more about topics of particular interest to you.<br><br>I will be using correct veterinary terminology throughout the course, both in written materials and in video presentations. That means that I will refer to an unspayed female dog as a bitch. I also will be using correct terms for anatomy. This is not intended to be shocking or unsettling. Use of correct terminology ensures clear understanding. Similarly, some images may be graphic but they are used to demonstrate a disease state or correct performance of a procedure and are intended for your education.<br>","suggestedReadings":"Much of the material for this course will be taken from <u><a href=\"http:\/\/chggtrx.com\/click.track?CID=267582&AFID=301076&ADID=1088031&SID=theriogenology&isbn_ean=9781416031390\">The Dog Breeder\u2019s Guide to Successful Breeding and Health Management<\/a><\/u> (ISBN:1-4160-3139-1).
