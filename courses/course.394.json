{"id":394,"shortName":"networksonline","name":"Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.  ","aboutTheCourse":"<div>Social networks pervade our social and economic lives. \u00a0 They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally. \u00a0 The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. \u00a0This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The course begins with some empirical background on\u00a0social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to\u00a0describe and measure networks. \u00a0 Next, we will cover a set of\u00a0models of how networks form, including random network models as well as\u00a0strategic formation models, and some hybrids. \u00a0 We will then discuss a series of\u00a0models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.<\/div><div><br><\/div>","targetAudience":2,"courseSyllabus":"<ul><li>Week 1:\u00a0Introduction, Empirical Background and Definitions<br><\/li><\/ul>Examples of Social Networks and their Impact, Definitions, Measures and Properties: Degrees, Diameters, Small Worlds, Weak and Strong Ties, Degree Distributions<br><br><ul><li>Week 2: Background, Definitions, and Measures\u00a0Continued<\/li><\/ul>Homophily, Dynamics, \u00a0Centrality Measures: Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, and Katz-Bonacich.\u00a0Erdos and Renyi Random Networks:\u00a0Thresholds and Phase Transitions,<br><br><ul><li>Week 3:\u00a0Random Networks\u00a0<br><\/li><\/ul>Poisson Random Networks, Exponential Random Graph Models, \u000f Growing Random Networks, Preferential Attachment and Power Laws, Hybrid models of Network Formation<br><br><ul><li>Week 4: \u00a0\u000f Strategic Network Formation\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><div>Game Theoretic Modeling of Network Formation, The Connections Model, The Conflict between Incentives and E\u000efficiency, Dynamics, Directed Networks, Hybrid Models of Choice and Chance<br><br><\/div><ul><li>Week 5:\u00a0\u00a0Di\u000bffusion on Networks.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>Empirical Background, The Bass Model,\u00a0Random Network Models of Contagion, The SIS model, Fitting a Simulated Model to Data<br><br><ul><li>Week 6:\u00a0\u00a0Learning on Networks.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>Bayesian Learning on Networks, The DeGroot Model of\u00a0Learning on a Network, Convergence of Beliefs, The Wisdom of Crowds, How Influence depends on Network Position.<br><br><ul><li>Week 7:\u00a0Games on Networks.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><div>Network Games, Peer Influences: \u00a0Strategic\u00a0Complements and Substitutes, the Relation between Network Structure and Behavior, A Linear Quadratic Game,\u00a0Repeated Interactions and Network Structures.<\/div><div><br><\/div>","courseFormat":"<p>The course will run for seven weeks, plus two for the final exam.&nbsp; Each week there will be\nvideo lectures available, as well as a standalone problem set and some occasional data\nexercises, and there will be a final exam at the end of the course for those who wish to earn a course certificate. &nbsp;<\/p>","suggestedReadings":"The course is self-contained, so that all the definitions and concepts you need to solve the problem sets and final are contained in the video lectures. &nbsp;Much of the material for the course is covered in a text: Matthew O.
