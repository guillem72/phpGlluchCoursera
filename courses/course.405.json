    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>The current international\nmonetary system has critical defects. An effective reform of the system calls\nfor a new international currency, for which the Renminbi may be a promising\ncandidate. Despite the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, certain prerequisites\nhave to be satisfied before the Renminbi can be internationalized. China needs\nto ensure full convertibility of the Renminbi and further develop its financial\nmarkets to facilitate the process of internationalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>This course will discuss various\naspects of the Renminbi internationalization. Specifically, innovative\nsuggestions will be provided on topics including the reform of the\ninternational monetary system, the opportunities and challenges of the Renminbi\ninternationalization, and the evolution of China’s monetary and exchange rate\npolicies. Since the internationalization of Renminbi is important to the future\nof Hong Kong as an international financial center, the lectures will also\ndiscuss the possible implications of this process for Hong Kong.<\/p>",
