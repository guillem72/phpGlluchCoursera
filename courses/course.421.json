Energy use has\n              done great good for humans by giving those in the\n              developed world the equivalent of 100 energy \"serfs\" to do\n              our bidding, making up roughly 10% of the economy, and\n              powering most of the economy.\u00a0 However, the unintended\n              consequences of energy use are affecting people around the\n              world and changing the climate in ways that will make life\n              much harder.\u00a0 Numerous options exist for development of a\n              sustainable energy system that provides a stronger\n              economy, more jobs, and greater security that is more\n              consistent with ethical principles.\u00a0 The course explores\n              these issues.<br>\n              \u00a0<br>\n              \u201cEnergy, the Environment, and Our Future\u201d will combine\n              student-centered instructional materials and film clips\n              from the PBS TV series\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2RyvpsIx47E\" target=\"_blank\">Earth: The Operators' Manual<\/a>, also\n              hosted by Richard Alley, to tell the history, present, and\n              possible futures of human energy use.\u00a0 <br>\n            <\/div>\n            <\/span><br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"(Subject to change before course begins)<br><br>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lesson 1.
