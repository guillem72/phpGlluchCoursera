    "shortDescription": "This course is designed to examine an array of issues related to the globalization of higher education and research. The main objective of the course is to enable students to better understand how and why universities are engaged in the globalization process, as well as what the key implications of this development process are.\n",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Universities and higher education systems worldwide are being transformed by new and changing actors, practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions of 'global competency' and 'international branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!<\/p><p><em>Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’ <\/em>is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:<\/p><p><ul><li>Provide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of higher education and research. &nbsp;<\/li><li>Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on <em>emergences<\/em> -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.<\/li><li>Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.<\/li><\/ul><\/p><p>In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented learning about how the higher education sector - from research to teaching, learning, and service (the 'third mission') - are changing.&nbsp;<\/p>",
