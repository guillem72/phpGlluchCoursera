    "shortDescription": "This course explores markets with frictions. The goal is to sharpen our economic reasoning, add a few twists that you are unlikely to have seen in other courses, and apply the methods to interesting phenomena. This should improve the way you think analytically about the economy, and help address interesting issues that come up in the real world.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>The classical economic theory of markets cannot account for some important\n    issues, such as the coexistence of unemployment and vacancies; credit market\n    rationing; or bubbles in asset prices. This course will explore\n    markets with frictions, shedding light on these issues and other fundamental\n    questions such as: What is a bank, and why do we use money?<br>\n<\/p>\n<br>",
