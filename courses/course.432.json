    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society. In recent\nyears, more and more young philosophers have become convinced\nthat, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progress in\nphilosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.\nThis is what our course will be concerned with:\nmathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help of mathematical\nmethods.<\/p><p><\/p><p>As we will try to show, one can analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.<\/p><p><\/p><p>So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy, <i>calculemus<\/i>. Let's calculate.<\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p>",
