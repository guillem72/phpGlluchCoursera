{"id":441,"shortName":"livearthistory","name":"Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers","language":"en","shortDescription":"Explore art history from the artist's perspective.  Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking.\n","aboutTheCourse":"<p>This course approaches the questions of \u201cart\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting, photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether character\/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process as a \u201cconversation\u201d with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so often historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional history-telling)? How do animators themselves \u201cwrite\u201d the largely unwritten history of their art through quotation, transposition and mash-ups? Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This course will combine short video lectures\/interviews and interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewed&nbsp;sketchbook and field work (suggested visits to local museums, film viewings, etc.) It is intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visual analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts, where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first place.<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1: Introduction<br>Week 2: Story<br>Week 3: Character<br>Week 4: World-Making<br>Week 5: Time &amp; Motion<br>Week 6: Reality Distortion<br>Week 7: Novelty<br>Week 8: Mash-Ups<br>Week 9: Conclusions<br>","courseFormat":"This class will consist of video lectures (about 10 minutes in length) combined with video&nbsp;interviews with guest artists and virtual \"field trips\" to artist studios and workplaces, museums and galleries. &nbsp;Lectures will focus on key topics, including \"story,\" \"character,\" \"language,\" \"time,\" \"dimensionality,\" \"novelty,\" etc., exposing students to a wide range of art from around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will be required to keep a sketchbook, complete \"looking, thinking and making\" assignments for peer assessment. &nbsp;A final exam will test comprehension of key concepts.","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Jeannene Przyblyski","estimatedClassWorkload":"2-4 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"Some college-level experience in the arts and humanities will be helpful. &nbsp;And the more the student is willing to complement classwork with independent looking and thinking about art, animation and video games (as well as comic books and graphic novels, film, etc.), the more they will get out of the class. &nbsp;Remember: &nbsp;Art is an ongoing process and art practice can't end in the classroom, wherever that classroom might be.","links":{}}
