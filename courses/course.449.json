At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence \u2013 inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology.<br><br><b>Learning Objectives<\/b><ul><li>Develop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis.<br><\/li><li>Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis.<br><\/li><li>Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings.<br><\/li><li>Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis.<br><\/li><li>Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.<\/li><\/ul><b>Accreditation Statement<\/b><br>The Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.<br><br><b>AMA Credit Designation Statement<\/b><br>The Stanford University School of Medicine designates this enduring material for a maximum of 6.0&nbsp;<i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)\u2122.<\/i>&nbsp;Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.<br><br><b>Disclosures<\/b><br><b>The following Course Director has indicated that he has a relationship with industry to disclose relative to the content of this activity during the planning phase.

It is the intent of the bill, which went into effect July 1, 2006, to encourage physicians and surgeons, CME providers in the State of California and the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to meet the cultural and linguistic concerns of a diverse patient population through appropriate professional development. The planners and speakers of this CME activity have been encouraged to address cultural issues relevant to their topic area. The Stanford University School of Medicine Multicultural Health Portal also contains many useful cultural and linguistic competency tools including culture guides, language access information and pertinent state and federal laws.
