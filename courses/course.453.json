    "shortDescription": "This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity. ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing\non the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old\npatent clerk, introduced in his so-called “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence\nthat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why\ndidn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n<br>\n<br>Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more\nquantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more\nqualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young\nEinstein and\/or the special theory of relativity.\n<br>",
