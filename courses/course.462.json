    "aboutTheCourse": "<span> Science is really not about looking up facts in an encyclopedia.&nbsp; It is a <i>process<\/i> that\nextends what we know into the realm of the unexplored.&nbsp; This can be\nexciting, certainly; to be able to sneak a peek at the Universe at its strange,\nawesome, cosmic best.&nbsp; But it is very different from your run-of-the-mill\nstandard “textbook” idea of science.&nbsp; Science is a social, human endeavor.<br><\/span><br><span>And as human beings, we crave authenticity.&nbsp; We have seen the trappings of\nsociety, we act as if we have mastered technology, and yet we know that\nsomething is lacking.&nbsp; We have succumbed to the lure of Ebay, Facebook and\nAmazon (at least, I know <u>I<\/u> have!), and yet we remain unsatisfied at some primal level.&nbsp;\nIt’s time to peel away the layers of glitzy imagery and use our machines to exploit their ultimate purpose: the capability to&nbsp; process large amounts\nof data with instructions that we provide, in order to test our ideas about how\nthe Universe seems to behave.&nbsp; In short, to do Science.<\/span><span>&nbsp; For the\nfirst time, it is possible for the interested student (and we are <u>all<\/u>\nstudents, <u>especially<\/u> those that have any claim to be considered\n“learned” , such as the instructor!) to have this experience on-line. <br><br><\/span><p>The subject matter for this course will be divided into two\nbroad components which will be interwoven in an interdisciplinary fashion. The first is a general introduction to the physics and astronomy\ninformation you will need to understand basic phenomena that occur in the realm\nof x-ray astrophysics; the second is the presentation of authentic satellite\ndata from various exciting types of x-ray sources, which you will analyze to\nbetter understand the working of the high-energy Universe in which we live.\nThere are no prerequisites for this course, other than high-school mathematics\n(algebra and trigonometry).<br><\/p><p> I hope you will enjoy your experience in \"Analyzing the Universe\".<\/p>",
