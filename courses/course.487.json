{"id":487,"shortName":"physics1","name":"Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors","language":"en","shortDescription":"This is a 12 week course, currently scheduled to start on Monday, April 14, 2014 and finishing on Friday, July 11.  This introductory physics course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications. ","aboutTheCourse":"<p>This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.\u00a0 How does gravity control the motion of the\nplanets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?\u00a0 Why does a spinning skater spin faster when\nshe pulls her arms in? \u00a0Why is a\nperpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style.\u00a0\nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called\nNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July\n14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed\nusing classical mechanics, and nothing\nmore.<\/p>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p><\/p><p>\n\n<\/p><p>Week 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  1D motion: speed, velocity and acceleration<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D motion continued.\u00a0\u00a0\nVector Math.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 3: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motion in 2D.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 4: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newton\u2019s Laws.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 5: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applications of Newton\u2019s Laws.\u00a0 Friction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 6: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work and Energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 7: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Energy. <\/p>\n\n<p>Week 8: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gravity and orbits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 9:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Momentum and Collisions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 10: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rotational Motion.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 11: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Angular Momentum.\u00a0 Static Equilibrium.<\/p>\n\n<p>Week 12: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple Harmonic Motion.<\/p>\n\n <p><\/p>","courseFormat":"<p>This 12-week class will consist of assigned readings, plus video\nlectures, 3 times a week, which are video captures of the actual lectures given\nto freshmen engineers \u00a0at the University\nof Colorado at Boulder (CU) in the fall semester of 2013.\u00a0 During each lecture, there are several pauses\nfor in-class \u201cConcept Test\u201d questions.\u00a0 There\nare weekly homework assignments, 2 midterm exams, and a final exam. \u00a0\u00a0This\nonline course will resemble the actual course at CU as closely as possible,\nwith very similar homeworks and exams.<\/p>","suggestedReadings":"<p>Weekly reading assignments for this course will be from a\nfree, online textbook, that will be posted on this site.<\/p>","instructor":"Michael Dubson","estimatedClassWorkload":"8-12 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<p>This course is aimed at freshmen engineering students and\nother physical science majors at the University-level.\u00a0 Students will need a good command of algebra\nand trigonometry before they start this course, and some acquaintance with\ncalculus.\u00a0 Calculus is not used much in\nthis course, and we will review that calculus that we do use. \u00a0For the student taking this course for credit\nat the University of Colorado, Calculus 1 is the co-requisite for the course;\nthat is, they are required to take calc1 concurrently, if they have not already\ntaken it.\u00a0 No previous knowledge of\nphysics is assumed, but this course is fast-paced and we cover a lot of\nmaterial, so any previous high-school physics course will be very useful.\u00a0 <br><\/p>","links":{}}
