It\nstarts a \u201cconversation\u201d with users and stakeholders inside and outside\nan organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about\ncomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop \u201cstories,\u201d\nwhich lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy\npractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises \u2013 in all departments\nand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.\n<br>\n<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that\nif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their\njob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier\n\u2013 creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is\nvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their\nenterprise stand out.\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of their area of work, position or expertise, Content Strategy\npractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile\nmedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,\nactionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic\ncontent they produce enhances the user\u2019s lives and&nbsp;deepens their\nunderstanding and engagement with the organization.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it\nis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,\ntrustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.\nOften it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional\njournalism under-serves or does not reach.&nbsp;<br>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"In this course, professionals at all levels of an organization will learn the best ways to engage an audience they want and need by smartly implementing their important, strategic stories and information and by using proven tools and techniques to enhance an audience\u2019s experiences and interest.<br><br>To earn a Verified Certificate, learners must watch the MOOC's videos, answer the Learning Questions that accompany each video, participate in the discussion forums, develop and complete a Case Study, and evaluate the cases of three other MOOC participants.","courseFormat":"","suggestedReadings":"","instructor":"Bobby Calder, Candy Lee, Randy Hlavac, Andrew Gruen, John Lavine and Rachel Davis Mersey","estimatedClassWorkload":"2-4 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"This MOOC serves professionals who want to learn to create trustable,\nengaging and often interactive content to advance their enterprise\u2019s future.\nThis MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content development\nexperience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understand\naudiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics and videos to\nconvey<b> <\/b>their organization\u2019s most important goals.<br>","links":{}}
