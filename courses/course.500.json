The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts like repetition, variation, and elaboration.  The course aims to offer a creative space even within the restrictions of stylistic emulation.","aboutTheCourse":"<div>This course aims to give students a set of approaches for composition in the style of Classical and Romantic era European art music. \u00a0The principles and skills in this course engage one as\u00a0much as possible in the thinking of composers from those eras, giving the student compositional\u00a0freedoms that composers of that era enjoyed. \u00a0The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts such as\u00a0common tones, leading tones, repetition, variation, and elaboration.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The course offers presentations, demonstrations, and exercises for self-<\/div><div>evaluation. \u00a0Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures found\u00a0during the 18th and 19th centuries.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonal\u00a0harmony, musicianship, and\/or some similar music theory introductory course. \u00a0Students should be\u00a0fairly\u00a0comfortable with roman numeral analysis or, at least, chord symbols and common harmonic\u00a0progressions. \u00a0This course is not aimed exclusively at musicians with a classical music\u00a0background. \u00a0Rock, pop, and jazz musicians might find this course interesting as a stylistic\u00a0contrast to the genres they usually work in.<\/div>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1: Chords in Classical Music, Voicing Chords, Basic Harmony Progressions, Voice Leading, Introduction to Texture<br><br>Week 2: Basic Progressions with Inversions, Voice Leading 2, Keyboard Voicing, Creating Accompaniment, Textural Reduction<br><br>Week 3: Sequential Progressions, Non-chord Tones<br><br>Week 4: Diatonic chord substitution, Cadences, Parallel Period Form, Melodic Writing Techniques<br><br>Week 5: Chromatic Substitution, 2-voice counterpoint<br><br>Week 6: Progressions within Progressions, Alberti Bass, Rounded Binary Form","courseFormat":"The class will consist of a series of video lectures between 8-12 minutes each in length.
