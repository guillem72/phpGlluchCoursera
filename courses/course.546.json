In this course we analyse examples from schools in different parts of the world, and bring professional teachers, headteachers and policymakers together to share their best ideas and inspiring stories.\nThe materials in the course are based on studies carried out for the UNESCO Institute of IT in Education, Moscow.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>Teachers and policymakers working in all sectors of\neducation now recognise the importance and value of technology for learning and\nteaching. The UCL Institute of Education, University of London (IOE&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ioe.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.ioe.ac.uk\/<\/a>)&nbsp; and the UNESCO Institute for IT in\nEducation (IITE <a href=\"http:\/\/iite.unesco.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/iite.unesco.org\/<\/a> ) are collaborating to run this professional development course\nfor teachers, headteachers and policymakers working in the Primary Education\nsector.<\/p>\n\n<p>The course is part of IITE\u2019s role to support and promote an\nactive community of practitioners and policymakers in the use of digital\ntechnologies for learning and teaching.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is also linked to the UCL IOE\u2019s mission to promote excellence in education and\nprofessional practice through advancing knowledge and understanding.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n<p>The resources for the course are derived from teachers\u2019 Primary\npractice in different countries. The UNESCO IITE funded an international\nproject to collect practices, experiences, policies, cases and data from several\ncountries in different parts of the world. The outcome is two volumes\nsummarising the findings. The basis of the course is therefore not a\nparticular theoretical approach, but a collection of good and interesting\nexperiences and exemplars of ICT in primary education from across the world.\nWhat unites all the authors and teachers involved in the project is our\nconviction that ICT, used well, by good teachers, alongside other methods, can\nenable every child to achieve their learning potential.<\/p><p><br><\/p><strong>Announcement for US based teachers:<\/strong><br><p><span>Coursera and its partners are proud to\noffer eligible teachers <b><u>free verified certificates<\/u><\/b> for this\ncourse and other high-quality teacher professional development courses, through\nthe ConnectED effort announced by President Obama.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>To participate in this opportunity, district leaders simply need\nto approve Coursera teacher professional development by completing a brief form\nat: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coursera.org\/tpd\">www.coursera.org\/tpd<\/a><u>.<\/u><\/p>\n\n<p>Teachers interested in this opportunity are also encouraged to\nfollow the link to learn more and<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1t7G3eSUuWvX3arzktgyuzHhMR188D0YnVT-T_aT2pgQ\/viewform\"> complete the form<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Once a district\u2019s form has been verified, the district leader will\nbe notified and teachers in the district will receive access to free verified\ncertificates for Coursera professional development.<\/p>\n\n<p>Coursera and its partners thank educators\nfor the hard work they do every day and hope this opportunity will allow them\nto continue developing their craft in a meaningful and flexible way.<\/p><br>","targetAudience":3,"courseSyllabus":"<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n    <\/ul><strong>The 21st Century Primary School<\/strong><br><ul><li>Orientation<\/li><li>Why should we consider using ICT in primary schools?<\/li><li>The 21st Century school environment<\/li><li>Supporting teachers' needs<\/li><li>Reflecting on the lessons learned<br><\/li><\/ul><strong>How does ICT make a difference?<\/strong><br><ul><li>Orientation<\/li><li>Dimensions of change within the school<\/li><li>Beyond the school -
