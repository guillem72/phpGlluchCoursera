    "shortDescription": "Learn the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  This course is directed towards people who are in science or engineering fields outside of the disciplines of electrical or computer engineering.  ",
    "aboutTheCourse": "This course is a first introduction to electrical systems. It includes\nthe analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors\nwith DC and AC sources in the time domain and in the frequency domain.\nLaboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from\nthe lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific\nor technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The\ncoverage is not as deep as a circuits course aimed at electrical engineers.\nThere are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course\nthat serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience. The course is ideal\nfor someone who wants to gain a basic understanding of electrical circuits,\nsomeone who wants to get better intuition for what they have already learned,\nprecocious hobbyists, or for someone who is considering electrical engineering\nas a career.",
