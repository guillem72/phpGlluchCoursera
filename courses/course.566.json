    "shortDescription": "This multidisciplinary course will emphasize the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Topics will include patient self-management, appropriate use of technologies, nutrition, behavior modification and pharmacotherapy in the management of this disease. The course will conclude by summarizing new basic science research regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Over a dozen faculty from UC San Francisco's Schools of Pharmacy, Medicine, Nursing, and Dentistry will present on topics including the epidemiology, diagnosis, nutritional strategies for self-management, the role of insulin in managing diabetes, effects of diabetes on oral\/dental health, and current research in the field.",
