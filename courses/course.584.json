Asian Americans, like other ethnic groups, have low recruitment, accrual and retention rates in cancer clinical trials. This represents a significant challenge on a national level for health advocates, healthcare institutions and the National Cancer Institute. To improve communication and awareness of clinical trials for Asian American patients, it is important to increase learners’ knowledge about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility. This online course will educate healthcare providers and allied health professionals about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility skills as well as provide educational resources and tips for reinforcing change in practice to improve outcomes in Asian American clinical trial participation.<br><br><b>Learning Objectives<\/b><ul><li>Develop strategies to determine appropriate patients for clinical trials.<br><\/li><li>Apply cultural humility skills to effectively communicate with Asian American patients about cancer clinical trials.<br><\/li><li>Identify at least 5 ways that will reinforce change in practice to incorporate clinical trials education and referral among Asian American patients and apply it in practice.<br><\/li><li>Recognize how to access at least 5 cancer clinical trial resources and use them in education and referral.<\/li><\/ul><b>Disclosures<\/b><br><b>The following planner and speaker indicated that he has relevant financial relationships with industry to disclose relative to the content of this activity:<\/b><br><i>Contracted Research for clinical trials with Genentech, Novartis, Bristol, Ipsen, Tercica, Gilead and Newlink<\/i><br>George Fisher, MD.
