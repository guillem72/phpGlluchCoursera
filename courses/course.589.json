    "shortDescription": "Students who have successfully completed this course in-person have described it as a survey class on sleep that is team taught by experts.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "The objective of this course is to give students the most up-to-the-date\ninformation on the biological, personal, and societal relevance of sleep.\nPersonal relevance is emphasized by the fact that the single best predictor\nof daytime performance is the quality of the previous night's sleep. The\nbrain actively generates sleep, and the first third of the course will\noverview the neurobiological basis of sleep cycle control. The course provides\na cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances\nsuch as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The\nsecond third of the course will cover sleep-dependent changes in physiology\nand sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders\nof excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic\ncontrol. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote\nobesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00\nA.M., and the second portion of the class will highlight the relevance\nof sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will\nbe considered in the final portion of the class. In an increasingly complex\nand technologically oriented society, operator-error by one individual\ncan have a disastrous negative impact on public health and safety. Fatigue-related\nperformance decrements are known to have contributed as causal factors\nto nuclear power plant failures, transportation disasters, and medical\nerrors.",

    "recommendedBackground": "The topic of sleep is an ideal vehicle for teaching neuroanatomy, neurochemistry,\npharmacology, physiology, and cognitive neuroscience. Based on more than\n10 years of experience with the traditional classroom setting, students\nwho do well in the course are up to date on basic biology, chemistry, and\nneuroscience.\n<br>",
