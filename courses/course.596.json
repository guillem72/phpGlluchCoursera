    "aboutTheCourse": "The AMNH course <i>The Dynamic Earth: A Course for Educators<\/i> provides\nstudents with an overview of the origin and evolution of the Earth. Informed\nby the recently released <i>Next Generation Science Standards<\/i>,\nthis course examines geological time scales, radiometric dating, and how\nscientists “read the rocks.” We will explore dramatic changes in the Earth\nover the last 4 billion years, including how the evolution of life on Earth\nhas affected its atmosphere. In addition to looking at geology on a global\nscale, participants will take to their own backyards to explore and share\ntheir local geologic history.
