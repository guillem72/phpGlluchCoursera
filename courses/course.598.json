    "shortDescription": "This course is the second in a trilogy of short courses. In this part, we apply some of the concepts we covered in Part I to study the development of science and technology in Chinese society, particularly in light of the influence the Industrial Revolution in the West has had on China’s technological development.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "Having mastered in general terms some of the key concepts used in understanding\nthe relationship between science\/technology and society, this course begins\nto apply those concepts to China, historically and chronologically. Concepts\nsuch as path dependency\/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others\nwill be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and\ntechnology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed\nby developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we\ncan understand how that series of events affected the development of science\nand technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation\nfor <b><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/stschina3\">Part III<\/a><\/u><\/b>.",
