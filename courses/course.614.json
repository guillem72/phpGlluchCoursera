    "shortDescription": "Tinkering activities provide a powerful way to inspire students' interest, engagement, and understanding in science. The Tinkering Fundamentals course will help educators and enthusiasts develop a practice of tinkering and making. This course will focus on key design elements of high-quality, science-rich tinkering activities, effective facilitation strategies and environmental organization.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "<div>The Tinkering Fundamentals course offers educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making. &nbsp;We see tinkering as a serious endeavor--one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. &nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities. Working with learning scientists, we have identified a set of design principles and indicators of learning that can help you to integrate tinkering activities into your elementary and middle school science programs.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Tinkering typically blends the high- and low-tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports self-expression among children as well as&nbsp;adults. &nbsp;This course focuses on key design elements of high quality, science-rich tinkering activities, along with helpful facilitation strategies, and tips for organizing the learning environment. Selected tinkering activities are centered on circuits for this course. &nbsp;We review the ways in which tinkering supports science learning by providing opportunities to deepen engagement, intentionality, innovation, collaboration, and understanding. This course will excite you, inspire you, and get you tinkering in no time.<br><br><strong>NOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you need to obtain or purchase course&nbsp;materials as soon as possible.<\/strong> Material bundles are available from the Exploratorium store online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artoftinkering.com\" title=\"Link: http:\/\/www.artoftinkering.com\">www.artoftinkering.com<\/a>, or you can gather your own supplies using our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ggyeYdACmhMsBMd4UM-eo2qivwQN_2Ww34oyfzNIrmg\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">recommended materials list<\/a>.<br><\/div>",
