{"id":620,"shortName":"earlychildhood","name":"Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children\u2019s Development","language":"en","shortDescription":"During the early childhood years children gain knowledge and skills that provide the foundation for later learning. Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers. This course is intended to increase teachers\u2019 knowledge about specific types of teacher-child interactions that promote young children\u2019s development. The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care.","aboutTheCourse":"<p>When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day\n    that makes a difference in children\u2019s lives, there\u2019s clear evidence that\n    it\u2019s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most\n    important.\u00a0 And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions\n    that lead to children\u2019s development and learning.\u00a0 So this course\n    focuses on those interactions.\u00a0 By the end of the course, you should\n    have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that\n    foster learning and development among your students. <br><\/p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to\nyoung children\u2019s development, this course will focus on one area in particular\n\u2013 Emotional Support. <\/p>\n\n<p>This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the\nfoundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\/p><p>What do you need to <b>know<\/b> to be a really effective early childhood\n    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge \u2013 knowledge about children\u2019s\n    development, about the content they\u2019re teaching, about effective teaching\n    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,\n    and about themselves. In this course we\u2019ll focus a bit on knowledge about\n    children\u2019s development and we\u2019ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge\n    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and\n    development.<\/p>\n<p>Another part of effective teaching is <b>seeing<\/b>. All the knowledge\n    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good\n    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like \u2013 in lots of different\n    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers\n    tell us they don\u2019t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers\n    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get\n    them. We\u2019ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom\n    videos and we\u2019ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately we can\u2019t learn to be an effective teacher without practice\n    \u2013 we need to spend some time <b>doing<\/b> \u2013 enacting the teaching practices\n    that we\u2019ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really\n    learn about them \u2013 you need to spend some time practicing the types of\n    interactions we\u2019ll be talking about.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective\u00a0\n    teachers spend time <b>reflecting<\/b> on their practice. We think of this\n    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying\n    glass \u2013 we\u2019ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have\n    learned throughout this course.<\/p>\n<p>Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget\n    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom\n    Assessment Scoring System \u2013 or CLASS(\u2122). CLASS is an observational measure\n    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective\n    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching\n    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe\n    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to\n    increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><span>\n <span><span>\n  <span>\n  <p>*********************************************************************<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n <\/span>\n<\/span><\/span><p>\n\n<\/p><p>The development of the course was funded, in part, by the\nInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant\nR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.\u00a0\nThe opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent\nviews of the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0<\/p><br>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<p><b>Week One \u2013 Creating Emotionally Supportive\nClassrooms:<\/b> <br><\/p><p>We\u2019ll take a closer look at the importance of interactions and the\npower that teachers have in the development of young children.
