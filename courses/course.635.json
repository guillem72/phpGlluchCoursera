    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about the world and\nhow it reacts to the forces acting on it. From suspension bridges holding up\nmiles of roadway, to sky-scraping buildings in the midst hurricanes, to huge\ndams retaining billions of gallons of water in a reservoir, these structures\nmust withstand both the forces of nature and the forces that mankind has\nintended for them. The analytical tools that designers use to create these\nstructures are deceptively simple, and it is the intent of this course to\nexplain things in a clear, straightforward manner.<\/p>",
