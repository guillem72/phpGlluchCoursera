All but\nthe last week include two sets of video lectures, divided into five or six\nsections of 15-20 minutes in length. Each video lecture is accompanied by\nin-video quiz questions to assess your comprehension and provide immediate\nfeedback. These are machine graded, as are the two required Mastery Quizzes. Two\nrequired 250-word writing assignments on thought-provoking problem-solving\nquestions are spread across the semester and require peer-review of other\nstudents\u2019 work. These will be assigned on Monday of the designated weeks,\ngiving you one week to complete them and a second week to peer grade. The\ncapstone project is to Design Your Own Roman City. You will concentrate in Weeks\n8 and 9 on the research and writing of the 500-word city design paper,\naccompanied by a city plan. Throughout the course, we will be interacting regularly\nin the online forum, which is an essential part of the Roman Architecture\nexperience.&nbsp;<\/p>","suggestedReadings":"The illustrated lectures are designed to be self-contained but we strongly recommend Diana E.
