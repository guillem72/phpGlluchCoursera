{"id":690,"shortName":"statistics","name":"Data Analysis and Statistical Inference ","language":"en","shortDescription":"This course introduces you to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. You will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.","aboutTheCourse":"The goals of this course are as follows:<br><ol><li>Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.<\/li><li>Use statistical software (R) to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.<\/li><li>Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.<\/li><li>Apply estimation and testing methods (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) to analyze single variables and the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.<\/li><li>Model and investigate relationships between two or more variables within a regression framework.<\/li><li>Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.<\/li><li>Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.<\/li><li>Complete a research project that employs simple statistical inference and modeling techniques.<\/li><\/ol>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<strong>Week 1: Unit 1 - Introduction to data<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Designing studies<\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Exploratory data analysis<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Introduction to inference via simulation<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 2: Unit 2 - Probability and distributions<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Defining probability<\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Conditional probability<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Normal distribution<\/li><li>Part 4 \u2013 Binomial distribution<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 3: Unit 3 - Foundations for inference<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Variability in estimates and the Central Limit Theorem<\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Confidence intervals<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Hypothesis tests<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 4: Finish up Unit 3 + Midterm<\/strong><ul><li>Part 4 \u2013 Inference for other estimators<\/li><li>Part 5 - Decision errors, significance, and confidence<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 5: Unit 4 - Inference for numerical variables<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 t-inference<br><\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Power<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Comparing three or more means (ANOVA)<\/li><li>Part 4 \u2013 Simulation based inference for means<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 6: Unit 5 - Inference for categorical variables<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Single proportion<\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Comparing two proportions<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Inference for proportions via simulation<\/li><li>Part 4 \u2013 Comparing three or more proportions (Chi-square)<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 7: Unit 6 - Introduction to linear regression<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Relationship between two numerical variables<\/li><li>Part 2 \u2013 Linear regression with a single predictor<\/li><li>Part 3&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Outliers in linear regression<\/li><li>Part 4 \u2013 Inference for linear regression<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 8: Unit 7 - Multiple linear regression<\/strong><ul><li>Part 1 \u2013 Regression with multiple predictors<\/li><li>Part 2&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Inference for multiple linear regression<\/li><li>Part 3 \u2013 Model selection<\/li><li>Part 4&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Model diagnostics<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 9: Review \/ catch-up week<\/strong><ul><li>Bayesian vs. frequentist inference<\/li><\/ul><strong>Week 10: Final exam<\/strong>","courseFormat":"<p>The class will include video lectures, between 5 and 10 minutes in length, containing a few quiz questions per video.

The course will closely follow this book, and hence the text can serve as supplementary material to the videos. In addition, practice problems will be assigned from the book.
