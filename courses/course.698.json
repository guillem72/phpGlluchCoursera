    "shortDescription": "Learn fundamental concepts in data analysis and statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples.",
    "aboutTheCourse": "This class presents fundamental concepts in data analysis and&nbsp;statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples.&nbsp;Students having taken this class should be able to summarize samples,&nbsp;perform relevant hypothesis tests and perform a collection of two&nbsp;sample comparisons. Classical non-parametric methods and discrete data&nbsp;analysis methods are discussed. &nbsp;The class is taught at a master's of&nbsp;biostatistics introductory level and requires Mathematical&nbsp;Biostatistics Boot Camp 1 as a prerequisite.\n<br><br>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.",
