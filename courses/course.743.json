{"id":743,"shortName":"cdt208","name":"Introduction to Computational Arts","language":"en","shortDescription":"This multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to, and exploration of electronic media in the arts. Lectures will cover concepts and presentations of artists working in various capacities with computers, as well as tutorials on specific software packages. ","aboutTheCourse":"<span><p>In this 17-week course we will introduce the fundamentals of computational arts\u2013covering basic programming, simple image processing and elementary sound recording. This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing.*<\/p><p>For programming we will be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.<\/p><p>For visuals we will cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.<\/p><p>For sound we will teach both Logic and Soundation. Logic is Apple\u2019s DAW or Digital Audio Workstation while Soundation is a free web-based multi-track audio editor. We\u2019ll be teaching the basics of digital audio\u2013including recording, and automating effects. <\/p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We\u2019ll cover the history of sound and art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.<\/p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 15 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data, specifically how image and sound are represented by the computer.<\/p><p>Additionally, you will create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Each week you will watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We\u2019re looking forward to working with you. <\/p><div>*If you are interested in just a part of this course, you may want to consider enrolling in the individual segments in the Spring (Intro to Computational Arts Processing, Visual Arts and Audio.) &nbsp;These courses will not include the use of eportfolio and will not have a summative capstone.&nbsp;<\/div><\/span>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p><br><\/p>\n<p><strong>Introduction to Computational Arts<\/strong><br>\nConsortium  for Digital Arts &amp; Technology (CDACT)<br>\nStony Brook University and Coursera \n<\/p><h2><strong>COURSE INFORMATION<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Instructors<\/strong><br>\n  <strong>Dr. Margaret Schedel<\/strong><br><br>\n  <strong>Catherine Katsafouros (TA)<\/strong><br><\/p>\n<p><strong>Course Description<\/strong><strong><br>\n<\/strong>This multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to,  and exploration of electronic media in the arts.

Your work on the  assignments, projects and group presentation will be assessed two ways: your  individual work to complete the assignment, project or presentation, and your  own review of your peers\u2019 work. Peer review counts as the participation  component of your own grade, which means for everything you hand in you will  also make substantive comments on the assignments which will be graded, and  rate others\u2019 comments<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<span>\n    <span>\n        <span>\n            \n                <p><strong>Description<\/strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Weight &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Participation    Component<\/strong><\/p>\n            \n        <\/span>\n        <span>\n            <span>\n                <p>Quizzes (14) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;0 %<\/p><\/span>\n        <\/span>\n        <span>\n            <span>\n                <p>Assignments (12) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 20 % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;20 % &nbsp;<\/p><\/span>\n        <\/span>\n        <span>\n            <span>\n                <p>Project 1 (visual) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20 % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25 %<\/p><\/span>\n        <\/span>\n        <span>\n            <span>\n                <p>Project 2 (sound) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 20 % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25 %<\/p><\/span><\/span>\n        \n        <span>\n            <span>\n                <p>Final Project\n                    <br>(visual, sound, programming) &nbsp; &nbsp; 25 % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25 %<\/p><\/span>\n        <\/span>\n    <\/span>\n<\/span>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Passing Grade = 75%<\/strong>\n<\/p><p><strong>Quizzes&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p><p>\nAfter watching each video lecture series, you  will take a multiple choice quiz which will count towards your final grade.

There are only three projects, and together they are worth the  majority of your grade. You can expect these projects to take at&nbsp; least 3-4 hours to complete. (Final project  should take 6 hours.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Group  Presentation<\/strong><br>\n  In groups of 4-7, you will create a five-minute  presentation that the other students can view. You can use any method or  technology for loading this that works with your eportfolio site and  collaborating. There will be a list of topics to choose from on a movement in  twentieth or 21st century art or music. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong> \u201cThe course schedule, policies, procedures,  and assignments in this course are subject to change in the event of  extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, and\/or to ensure better student  learning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>COURSE SCHEDULE<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Week 01-04 <\/strong>Introduction to Computing  and Processing<br>\n    <strong>Week 05-09 <\/strong>Introduction to Digital Art  and Photoshop\/Gimp<br>\n    <strong>Week 10-14:<\/strong> Introduction to Electronic  Music and Logic\/Soundation<br>\n    <strong>Week 15: <\/strong>Putting it All Together:  Programming, Visuals and Sound<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<span>\n  <span><span>\n    <p><strong>Assignments    due:<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Week 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Install Programs<\/p><\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Processing Assignment 1<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Processing Assignment 2<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 4 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Processing Assignment 3<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Image Assignment 1<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 6 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Image Assignment 2<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 7 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Image Assignment 3<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 8 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Image Assignment 4<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 9 &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong>Project 1 (Image)<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    10 &nbsp; <\/strong>Sound Assignment 1<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    11 &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Sound Assignment 2<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    12 &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Sound Assignment 3<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    13 &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Project 2 (Sound)<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    14 &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Portfolio Assignment 1<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    15 &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Project 3 (Processing, Sound and Image)<\/p>\n  <\/span>\n<\/span><\/span>\n<p><strong>Week 16 &amp; 17<\/strong> Project completion and peer grading&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course  Questions - FAQ<\/strong><br>\n  Have a question about the content of the course?
