{"id":765,"shortName":"functionalanalysis","name":"An Introduction to Functional Analysis","language":"en","shortDescription":"Learn about functional analysis","aboutTheCourse":"Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with spaces of\nfunctions. It is a valuable tool in theoretical mathematics as well as\nengineering. It is at the very core of numerical simulation.\n<br>\n<br>In this class, I will explain the concepts of convergence and talk about\ntopology. You will understand the difference between strong convergence\nand weak convergence. You will also see how these two concepts can be used.\n<br>\n<br>You will learn about different types of spaces including metric spaces,\nBanach Spaces, Hilbert Spaces and what property can be expected. You will\nsee beautiful lemmas and theorems such as Riesz and Lax-Milgram and I will\nalso describe Lp spaces, Sobolev spaces and provide a few details about\nPDEs, or Partial Differential Equations.\n<br>\n<br>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1: Topology; continuity and convergence of a sequence in a topological space.<br>Week 2: Metric and normed spaces; completeness<br>Week 3: Banach spaces; linear continuous functions; weak topology<br>Week 4: Hilbert spaces; The Riesz representation theorem<br>Week 5: The Lax-Milgram Lemma<br>Week 6: Properties of the Lp spaces<br>Week 7: Distributions and Sobolev Spaces<br>Week 8: Application: simulating a membrane<br><br>","courseFormat":"The class will consist of a series of lecture videos, usually between five and twelve minutes in length.\u00a0 There will be approximately one hour worth of video content per week. Some of the videos contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of the video lectures; you will be asked to solve some problems and evaluate the solutions proposed by your fellow classmates. There will be a final exam.<br><br>There will be some additionnal contents in the form of PDF files.<br><br>","suggestedReadings":"","estimatedClassWorkload":"6-8 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"The course is mostly self-contained; however, you need to be familiar with\nfunctions, derivatives and integrals. You need to know what A \u2229 B means and to know what a proof is. You should be fine if you have taken Calculus II and Algebra II. Students in Europe who have taken 120 ECTS in science should be fine as well.<br><br>Because this is an online class, having advanced and non-advanced students in a class will not be a problem; on the contrary we expect a wide range of interesting interactions. However, non-advanced students may have to work a bit more.<br>","links":{}}
