    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>In this data centric era, statistics has become an\nessential tool for processing information from the realm of public health and\nmedical research.&nbsp; Understanding\nboth the implications and limitations of the results from such research is essential for making informed treatment decisions, public health practice\nprotocols and policy recommendations.&nbsp;\nIn this class, a conceptual and interpretive approach is applied to some\nof the most used methods from basic statistics.&nbsp; The course will detail appropriate summary measures for\nquantifying the health of single populations, and comparing such outcomes\nbetween populations using results from representative but imperfect data\nsamples.&nbsp; Additionally, the role of\nuncertainty in sample based estimated will be covered, allowing for conclusions\nto be drawn regarding the larger populations under study while recognizing the\nimperfection in the study estimates.&nbsp;\nAll topics will be considered through a “conceptual lens” allowing\nstudents to focus on the “what”, “why”, and “so what” with regards to the\nimplications of research results.<\/p>\n<br>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.",
