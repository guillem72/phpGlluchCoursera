At the same time, we have always known that social factors\nplay a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences\nin who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how\npeople can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.\n<br>\n<br>This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas\ncontribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected\nby mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some\npeople think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health\nand illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families\nare affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to\ntreat mental illness and promote mental health.","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<div><strong>Week One:<\/strong> A brief history of madness&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div><strong>Week Two:<\/strong> What is mental health and what causes mental\n    illness?<\/div>\n<div><strong>Week Three:<\/strong> The social context of diagnosis and treatment\n    of mental illnesses<\/div>\n<div><strong>Week Four:<\/strong> Culture, mental health and mental illness<\/div>\n<div><strong>Week Five:<\/strong> Families, caregiving and mental illness<\/div>\n<div><strong>Week Six:<\/strong> Society, communities and mental health<\/div>","courseFormat":"The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes\nin length.
