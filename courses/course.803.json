    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Clinical trials are experiments designed to evaluate new\ninterventions to prevent or treat disease in humans.&nbsp; The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g.,\nhearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation\nprogram), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health\ndelivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions).&nbsp; We consider clinical trials experiments\nbecause the investigators rather the patients or their doctors select the\ntreatment the patients receive.&nbsp; Results\nfrom randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of\nevidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials\nincorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of\ntreatments are objective and unbiased. &nbsp;The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are\nshown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.<\/p>\n\n<p>The course will explain the basic principles for design of\nrandomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.&nbsp; In the first part of the course, students\nwill be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several\ncommon designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over\ndesigns.&nbsp; We will also explain some\nof the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of\ntreatment.&nbsp; In the second half of\nthe course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and\ninterpreted.&nbsp; Finally, we will\nreview the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments\non people.<\/p>\n<br>\nDeveloped in collaboration with <a href=http:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/offices-and-services\/center-for-teaching-and-learning\/our-services\/open-education-lab\/index.html>Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab<\/a>.",
