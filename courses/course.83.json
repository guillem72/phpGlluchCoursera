You\u2019ll learn the prospects for new generations of medications in neurology, psychiatry, aging, and treatment of substance abuse.\n","aboutTheCourse":"What happens in the body when a person smokes a cigarette? After several weeks of smoking? When a person takes antidepressant or antipsychotic medication? A drug for pain, migraine, or epilepsy? A recreational drug? Neuroscientists are beginning to understand these processes. You\u2019ll learn how drugs enter the brain, how they act on receptors and ion channels, and how \u201cmolecular relay races\u201d lead to changes in nerve cells and neural circuits that far outlast the drugs themselves. \u201cDrugs and the Brain\u201d also describes how scientists are gathering the knowledge required for the next steps in preventing or alleviating Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, schizophrenia, and drug abuse.","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"Week 1.
