    "aboutTheCourse": "<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Much of our daily life is spent taking part in various types of what we might call “political”\nprocedures. Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others\nin small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when\nwe carefully examine our group decision-making processes.&nbsp;<\/p><p>There are two types of group\ndecision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A <i>voting problem<\/i>: Suppose\nthat a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which\nrestaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where\nto go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a\nchoice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person\nfrom the group to act as a “dictator”? A <i>fair division problem<\/i>: Suppose that there is a cake and\na group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces\nto the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with\nvanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece\nthat is the same size. But, how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous\n(e.g., icing that is 1\/3 chocolate, 1\/3 vanilla and 1\/3 strawberry) and the children each want\ndifferent parts of the cake?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>",
