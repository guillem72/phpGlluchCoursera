    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>Health is important to everyone.&nbsp; For most people, that means that\nunderstanding the healthcare system is important.&nbsp; As a patient or a caregiver for a loved one,\nyour understanding of the system can mean everything from getting the right\nhelp, to economic stress in paying medical bills, to medical misadventures and\neven worse.&nbsp; And if you’re a healthcare\nprofessional (or are in training or want to be a healthcare professional someday),\nunderstanding the system is a critical – but often under-developed – part of\noptimizing the help you can provide your community.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite this importance, confident understanding of the US\nhealthcare system is alarmingly rare.&nbsp;\nThis course is designed to change that – by helping students understand\nthe core structure and accomplishments of the system, the recurring\nshortcomings, and attempted remedies through policy reform.&nbsp; Rather than emphasizing complexity (a focus\nof many other courses about healthcare policy), the lessons in this course will\nhighlight central themes that learners can take away from the course and apply\nto their own experiences – and other coursework – with confidence.&nbsp; Moreover, students who seek more advanced\ncontent will have ample opportunity to tailor their learning accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, through a unique, coursewide group exercise\nthat will serve as a keystone of this course, all learners will have the\nopportunity to learn how they can improve the US healthcare system.&nbsp; Whether as individuals, in groups, or as future\narchitects of system reform, students in this course will enjoy a premier\nopportunity to understand the US healthcare system – and their options for addressing\nproblems in the system – as they never have before. &nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>This course was co-developed by the course director, Matthew Davis, MD, MAPP, and course producer, Michael Rubyan, MPH. &nbsp;Davis is a senior faculty member and longtime teacher regarding health policy at the University of Michigan Medical School, School of Public Policy, and School of Public Health. &nbsp;Rubyan is a doctoral student at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.<\/p>",
