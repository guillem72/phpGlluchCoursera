Denis is a graduate of Harvey\nMudd College, and is currently finishing his MS in Machine Learning at\nGeorgia Tech. He is responsible for managing the coursera site, monitoring\nthe forums for student feedback, creating the homework assignments and\nquizzes, as well as recording weekly tutorials to help students with their\nprogramming.","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<p>Week 0 (Module 0): &nbsp;Introductions with an overview of the course\n    structure and content.&nbsp; Topics covered in this module include a description\n    of what is Computational Photography (i.e., whereby examples of dual photography\n    and panoramas are described) and reasons for studying this emerging interdisciplinary\n    field .<\/p>\n<p>Week 1 (Module 1): &nbsp;Overview of what is a digital image.&nbsp; Topics\n    covered in this module are image processing and filtering, with emphases\n    placed upon point processes, smoothing, convolution, cross-correlation,\n    gradients and edges.<\/p>\n<p>Week 2 (Module 2): &nbsp;Overview of cameras with emphases placed upon\n    the pinhole camera and optics (e. g., lenses, focal length), exposure time\n    and sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Week 3 (Module 3): &nbsp;Feature detection, matching and correspondence.\n    The panorama pipeline and some examples.
