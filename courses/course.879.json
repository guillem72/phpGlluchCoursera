Understand symmetry quantitatively, recognize its role in beauty and design, and appreciate its function in our everyday life. The level of difficulty is intermediate-to-hard with a workload is 7-10 hrs\/week.  This MOOC is for credit and students who obtain a Verified Certificate with an overall mark of more than 60% earn 3 Academic Units (AU) that can be directed towards either an Unrestricted Elective (UE) or General Elective (GE-STS) subject at NTU.  The usual NTU examination procedure requires student identification through webcam plus keystroke patterning for each assignment submission with a no-tolerance policy towards cheating (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/about\/terms\/honorcode and http:\/\/www.ntu.edu.sg\/SAO\/Pages\/HonourCode.aspx).  Students who are found to cheat, tamper with or falsify grades, or collude on assignments will be denied credits. It is not necessary to be enrolled at NTU to be awarded 3 AU and once received the AU remain valid 3 years. Because this is a for-credit course students must join the Signature Track stream within the first 2 week add-drop period (up to 21 August 2015, 2359 hrs) in accordance with NTU rules.","aboutTheCourse":"&nbsp;<br>Nanyang Technological University\nand Coursera are proud to offer Beauty, Form &amp; Function: An Exploration of\nSymmetry that caters to both non-specialists via a <strong>non-academic credit on-demand version<\/strong> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/webmail.ntu.edu.sg\/owa\/redir.aspx?C=qXFzMQlNjk2rDeiYsyjF3DSxSJUOk9IIIoPcPB3lFIXM756UNx5Lrvit9qv3-I2hyn9nyqeU3kI.&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.coursera.org%2flearn%2fsymmetry%2f\">https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/symmetry<\/a>) and specialists through this <strong>academic credit fixed-session version<\/strong>.&nbsp; Below can be found the:<br><strong><br>Syllabus \u2022 Grading Scheme \u2022 Recommended Readings \u2022 <br><\/strong><p><strong>Required Background <\/strong><strong><strong> \u2022 <\/strong>Essential Resources<\/strong><strong><strong> \u2022 <\/strong> Student Responsibility \u2022 FAQs<\/strong><br><\/p><p>Symmetry is everywhere.

From flowers\nto bridges, buildings, coke machines, and snowflakes; from molecules to\nwalnuts, fences, pine cones, and sunflowers; from music to children's drawings;\nfrom hubcaps to bank logos, propellers, wallpaper decorations, and pavements,\nwe recognize it if we walk around with open eyes and an open mind. This book\nprovides aesthetic pleasure and covert education, immersing the reader in both\nthe familiar and the unknown and leading always to unexpected discoveries.&nbsp; The authors, world-renowned\nscientists, have already produced a dozen books on symmetry for professionals\nas well as lay persons, for grownups as well as children, in English, Russian,\nGerman, Hungarian, and Swedish languages. They provide this attractive account\nof symmetry in few words and many, as many as 650, images in full colour from\nthe most diverse corners of our globe.

Using the book will enable\nstudents to read scientific papers and articles describing a crystal structure\nor use crystallographic databases with confidence and understanding.&nbsp; Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of\nthe subject the book includes a variety of applications as diverse as the\nrelationship between physical properties and symmetry, and molecular and\nprotein crystallography. As well as covering the basics the book contains an\nintroduction to areas of crystallography, such as modulated structures and\nquasicrystals, and protein crystallography, which are the subject of important\nand active research.<br><\/p>","estimatedClassWorkload":"4-10 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"<p><\/p>Mathematics at GCE\nAdvanced Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma or equivalent to junior\nhigh school.&nbsp;In addition, high school or undergraduate (freshman) chemistry is very helpful.<br><p><b>.<br><\/b><\/p><p><b>Essential Resources Required<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>This is an undiluted university\ncourse and resources equivalent to an undergraduate student at NTU are\nessential to complete these studies.&nbsp;\nThese include:<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p><ul><li><strong>Access to a Windows or Apple\npersonal computer:<\/strong>&nbsp; While lectures can be\nviewed on tablets and smartphones it is not possible to run the specialized\nprograms on these architectures.&nbsp; There can\nbe no troubleshooting of compatibility problems.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Access to a smartphone with\ncamera or a digital camera:<\/strong>&nbsp; The\nfield-work exercises involve photographing objects in your environment and\nanalysing their symmetry.&nbsp; Submission of these\ngraded exercises is essential to obtain course recognition.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Access to Microsoft Office or\nOpen Office:<\/strong> Homework must be prepared in PowerPoint or Word using the pptx and docx templates provided, converted to a\npdf and uploaded.
