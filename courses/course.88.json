    "aboutTheCourse": "<b>Note that this course is currently being offered in two consecutive parts. You may access part 1 of this split version <a href = \"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/interactivepython1\">here<\/a><\/b>.\n<p><p>\nThis course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.  To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n <p><\/p><p>\nThe primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing it.<\/p>",

    "recommendedBackground": "A knowledge of high school mathematics is required. While the class is designed for students with no prior programming experience, some beginning programmers have viewed the class as being fast-paced. For students interested in some light preparation\nprior to the start of class, we recommend a self-paced Python learning site such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/tracks\/python\">codecademy.com<\/a>",
