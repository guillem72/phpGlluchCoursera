    "aboutTheCourse": "<p>\n\nWe have all seen\nforensic scientists in TV shows, but how do they really work? What is the\nscience behind their work?<\/p><p>The course aims to\nexplain the scientific principles and techniques behind the work of forensic\nscientists and will be illustrated with numerous case studies from Singapore\nand around the world. <\/p><p>Some questions which we will attempt to address include:<\/p><ul><li>How did forensics\ncome about? What is the role of forensics in police work? Can these methods be\nused in non-criminal areas?<\/li><li>Blood. What is it?\nHow can traces of blood be found and used in evidence?<\/li><li>Is DNA chemistry\nreally so powerful?<\/li><li>What happens\n(biologically and chemically) if someone tries to poison me? What happens if I\ntry to poison myself?<\/li><li>How can we tell how\nlong someone has been dead? What if they have been dead for a really long\ntime?<\/li><li>Can a little piece\nof a carpet fluff, or a single hair, convict someone?<\/li><li>Was Emperor\nNapoleon murdered by the perfidious British, or killed by his wallpaper?<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>",
