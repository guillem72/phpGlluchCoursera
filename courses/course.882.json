","aboutTheCourse":"<p>\nTeachers\nin the classroom today have to be equipped with a variety of tools.\u00a0 Not only do they need to have subject\nknowledge and the ability to effectively teach, they must also have excellent\nclassroom management skills.\u00a0 When challenging\nbehavior in the classroom becomes a barrier to instruction, teachers who\nunderstand the fundamental principles behind functional behavior assessment\n(FBA) are prepared to address the behavior before it becomes so disruptive\nadditional resources outside the classroom are needed.\u00a0\u00a0 Have you ever had a student who is constantly talking out, getting out of his seat, and disturbing his classmates while you are trying to teach?\u00a0 No matter how many times you say something to him the behavior persists or gets worse?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0You continually ask yourself\u2026 Why does David do that?\nIn this course you will learn\nhow to determine \u201cWhy?\u201d a student engages in challenging behavior\u00a0and develop\ninterventions that promote positive behaviors, replacing challenging\nbehavior. <\/p><p>\n\n<\/p>\n\n<p>Whether teaching in a general education or special education setting, the key to\neffective behavior intervention is the functional behavior assessment.\u00a0\u00a0 There are various forms of the functional behavior assessment.\u00a0 We\u00a0will focus on how teachers can use the direct method of functional behavior assessment as part of their classroom\u00a0routine.\u00a0\u00a0In this\ncourse you will learn how to conduct\u00a0an FBA.\u00a0\u00a0You will learn how to\u00a0analyze the FBA to determine the antecedents that set the stage for challenging behavior, and\u00a0determine\u00a0the function\u00a0of the behavior.\u00a0You will also be able to use what you learn about principles of\nreinforcement,\u00a0 to create a function based\u00a0intervention addressing the antecedents, consequences and\u00a0promoting replacement behaviors. \u00a0 What you learn in\nthis course will help you\u00a0intervene with challenging behaviors in\nyour classroom before they escalate into behaviors that require involvement of additional\nschool faculty and staff beyond your classroom.\u00a0\n<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"Week One:  Introduction to Principles of Reinforcement and Punishment including an overview of concepts surrounding positive and negative reinforcement to increase or maintain behavior and punishment to decrease behavior.  \n\n<br><br>Week Two:  Foundations of Functional Behavior Assessment includes a discussion on what constitutes functions of behavior and an introduction to the direct method of functional behavior assessment.\n\n<br><br>Week Three:&nbsp; Conducting and Analyzing&nbsp;the Functional Behavior Assessment where you will&nbsp;learn&nbsp;how to conduct your own functional behavior assessment&nbsp;and analyze the results.<br><br>Week Four:&nbsp; Developing Function Based Intervention Methods includes a discussion of how changes to antecedents and consequences&nbsp;of challenging behavior can be made and how to reinforce replacement behaviors.","courseFormat":"The course consists of video lectures, readings, quizzes and discussions.","suggestedReadings":"Readings will come from open source\u00a0websites and articles\u00a0freely available on the internet.","estimatedClassWorkload":"2-4 hours\/week","recommendedBackground":"Experience working in a PreK-12 classroom.","links":{}}
