The topics covered include elementary signal theory; time- and frequency-domain analysis of signals; conversion of analog signals to a digital form; and how information can be represented with signals. Signal processing, both analog and digital, allow information to be extracted and manipulated. The course then turns to information theory, which demonstrates the technological advantages of digital transmission.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The course text was written by the instructor for this course and is entirely online. You can print your own hard copy or view the material entirely online.<\/div>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<strong>Elements of signal and system theory<\/strong><br>Week 1: Digital and analog information; block diagrams: sources, systems, sinks.
