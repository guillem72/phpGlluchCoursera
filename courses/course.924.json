    "aboutTheCourse": "<br><strong>Please Note: &nbsp;If you are signing up for the new run of Introduction to Chemistry that begins August 25th, the course has been split into two parts.<\/strong><br><br><strong>To sign up for the new run of Introduction to Chemistry, please go to this url<\/strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/chem991-001\" title=\"Link: https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/chem991-001\"><strong>https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/chem991-001<\/strong><\/a><strong>&nbsp;and enroll in this new version of the course.<\/strong><br><br>This is an introductory course for students with limited or no background in chemistry; chemical problem solving will be emphasized. The goal of the course is to prepare students for further study in the chemistry needed\nfor many science, health, and policy professions. Topics include introductions to atoms, molecules, ions, the periodic table, stoichiometry, chemical reactions, bonding, thermochemistry, and gas laws.\n<br>\n<br>Each week the course will contain short video lectures with interactive questions embedded in the lectures. Students will have opportunities to practice each week via exercises at two levels of depth: one set of foundational\nproblems directly related to lecture videos and another set of problems requiring more synthesis of ideas and application of pre-existing algebra skills. Students who complete the course while earning an average of 70% of more on the foundational problem\nsets, writing assignment, and exams will receive a signed statement of accomplishment. Students who complete the course and achieve an average of 85% or more on the foundational problem sets, advanced problem sets, writing assignment, and exams will receive\na signed statement of accomplishment with distinction.<br><br>Course icon from <a href=\"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Glass_is_Liquide.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia commons<\/a>.<br>",
