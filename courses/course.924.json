The goal of the course is to prepare students for further study in the chemistry needed\nfor many science, health, and policy professions. Topics include introductions to atoms, molecules, ions, the periodic table, stoichiometry, chemical reactions, bonding, thermochemistry, and gas laws.\n<br>\n<br>Each week the course will contain short video lectures with interactive questions embedded in the lectures. Students will have opportunities to practice each week via exercises at two levels of depth: one set of foundational\nproblems directly related to lecture videos and another set of problems requiring more synthesis of ideas and application of pre-existing algebra skills. Students who complete the course while earning an average of 70% of more on the foundational problem\nsets, writing assignment, and exams will receive a signed statement of accomplishment. Students who complete the course and achieve an average of 85% or more on the foundational problem sets, advanced problem sets, writing assignment, and exams will receive\na signed statement of accomplishment with distinction.<br><br>Course icon from <a href=\"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Glass_is_Liquide.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia commons<\/a>.<br>","targetAudience":0,"courseSyllabus":"<u>Week One<\/u>: Introductions with an overview of scientific methods, scientific notation, measurements, units and unit conversions, using proper significant figures to indicate precision, general concepts in matter and energy including definitions of\natoms, elements, molecules, and compounds, chemical formula stoichiometry, basic layout of the periodic table, endothermic and exothermic reactions, Coulomb\u2019s law, and heat capacity.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Week Two<\/u>: More study of atomic and molecular structure, information on the periodic table including some periodic trends, the subatomic particles most critical to chemical reaction and calculations, ions, isotopes, atomic and molecular mass, moles,\nintroduction to ionic and covalent bonding concepts, and nomenclature including some polyatomic ions.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Week Three<\/u>: Introduction to chemical composition calculations (compound stoichiometry); introduction to chemical reaction equations, including identifying and balancing simple acid-base, redox, dissolution, and precipitation reactions; more practice\nwith gram\/mole calculations.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Week Four<\/u>: Reaction calculations, including limiting reagent, yield, and enthalpy changes; practice writing and balancing chemical reaction equations; stoichiometry practice and review.
