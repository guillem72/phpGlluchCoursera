    "recommendedBackground": "<p><span>Students who take this course should ideally have\nat least a basic knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.  For example, students should be familiar with\nthe basic structure and function of the central and peripheral nervous system,\nincluding the lobes of the brain, the various parts of the brainstem and spinal\ncord, the main ascending and descending central pathways, and basic properties of\nperipheral nerves and muscle. Having at least a basic understanding of the way\nvarious cells in the nervous system work (such as properties of action\npotentials and other aspects of neural transmission) will be helpful but not\nessential for this course.  To make sure\neveryone is up to speed at the beginning, the class will start with an overview\nof the anatomy and functions of the nervous system as they relate to the\nvarious clinical diseases covered during the course.<\/span><\/p>",
