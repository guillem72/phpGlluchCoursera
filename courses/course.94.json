It will allow you to:<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand different planning problems<\/li>\n<li>Have the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems<\/li>\n<li>Know how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains<\/li>\n<li>Have the ability to make use of AI planning literature<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Planning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.<\/p>","targetAudience":1,"courseSyllabus":"<div>Week 1: Introduction and Planning in Context<\/div>\n<div>Week 2: State-Space Search: Heuristic Search and STRIPS<br>Week 3: Plan-Space Search and HTN Planning<\/div>\n<div><i>One week catch up break<\/i><\/div>\n<div>Week 4: Graphplan and Advanced Heuristics<\/div>\n<div>Week 5: Plan Execution and Applications<\/div>\n<div><i>Exam week<\/i><\/div>\n<p>The January 2015 session&nbsp;was the final version of the course.

Quizzes and assessments throughout the course will assist in learning. Some weeks will involve recommended readings. Discussion on the course forum and via other social media will be encouraged. A mid-course catch up break week and a final week for exams and completion of assignments allows for flexibility in study.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can engage with the course at a number of levels to suit your interests and the time you have available:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><i>Awareness Level<\/i> - gives an overview of the topic, along with introductory videos and application related features. This level is likely to require 2-3 hours of study per week.<\/li>\n<li><i>Foundation Level<\/i> - is the core taught material on the course and gives a grounding in AI planning technology and algorithms. This level is likely to require 5-6 hours of study per week of study.<\/li>\n<li><i>Performance Level<\/i> - is for those interested in carrying out additional programming assignments and engaging in creative challenges to understand the subject more deeply. This level is likely to require 8 hours or more of study per week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","suggestedReadings":"<div>The course follows a text book, but this is not required for the course:&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1558608567\/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1558608567&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=coursera-20\">Automated Planning: Theory &amp; Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence)<\/a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"margin: 0px !important; border: currentColor !important; border-image: none !important;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=coursera-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1558608567\"> by M.
